"""Reduce the data size of COCO experiment folder(s) from the default logger.

Data are copied into a new folder and then reduced in place.

Usage on a system shell::

     python -m cocopp.reduce_size folder_name

`folder_name` may be a single experiment folder or may contain several full
experiment folders. In either case, the reduction is applied to all
admissible single data files found anywhere under `folder_name`.

Further arguments denote the functions applied to the files, by default
``reduce_dat reduce_tdat remove_x``.

Usage in an IPython/Python shell::

    import cocopp
    cocopp.reduce_size.main(folder_name)

A second argument may contain a `tuple` or `list` of the functions names
applied to the files, by default ``("reduce_dat", "reduce_tdat",
"remove_x")``.

Under a *nix shell, the result can then be check with ``du -sh *``.

Details: this script removes lines in the data files which are not needed
with `cocopp.main`. Comment lines starting with ``#`` or ``%`` are
unchanged. The first and third columns are considered as evaluations
(costs) and f-values (quality indicator to be minimized) respectively.
