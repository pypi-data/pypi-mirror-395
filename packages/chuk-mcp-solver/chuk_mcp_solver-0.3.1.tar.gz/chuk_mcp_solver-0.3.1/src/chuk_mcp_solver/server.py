    This tool solves discrete optimization and constraint satisfaction problems.
    It supports integer and boolean variables, linear constraints, global constraints
    (all_different, element, table), implications, and linear objectives.

    Use cases include:
    - Project scheduling and resource allocation
    - Sudoku and logic puzzles
    - Configuration optimization
    - Tool/model selection under constraints
    - Routing and assignment problems
    - Budget allocation

    Args:
        mode: Solver mode - 'satisfy' to find any feasible solution,
              'optimize' to find the best solution according to the objective.
        variables: List of decision variables, each with:
            - id (str): Unique identifier
            - domain (dict): Domain specification with:
                - type (str): 'bool' or 'integer'

                - upper (int): Upper bound for integers (default 1)
            - metadata (dict, optional): Context for explanations
        constraints: List of constraints, each with:
            - id (str): Unique identifier
            - kind (str): Constraint type - 'linear', 'all_different', 'element',
                         'table', or 'implication'
            - params (dict): Constraint-specific parameters:
                For 'linear': terms (list of {var, coef}), sense ('<=', '>=', '=='), rhs (number)
                For 'all_different': vars (list of variable ids)
                For 'element': index_var (str), array (list of int), target_var (str)
                For 'table': vars (list of str), allowed_tuples (list of lists)
                For 'implication': if_var (str), then (nested constraint dict)
            - metadata (dict, optional): Description and context

            - solutions: List of solutions with variable assignments
            - explanation: Human-readable summary and binding constraints

    Tips for LLMs:
        - Start with a small model to test; gradually add complexity.
        - For Sudoku: use 'all_different' constraints for rows, columns, and blocks.
        - For scheduling: use linear constraints for precedence and capacity.
        - Variable metadata is useful for building readable explanations.
        - Constraint metadata helps identify which constraints are tight.
        - If infeasible, check constraint metadata to diagnose conflicts.
        - Use 'satisfy' mode for puzzles; 'optimize' mode for cost/time minimization.

    """Solve a task assignment problem.

    This is a high-level interface for assignment and matching problems. Use this instead
    of solve_constraint_model when you need to assign tasks to agents/workers with
    capacity and skill constraints.

    Args:
        agents: List of agents available to perform tasks, each with:
            - id (str): Unique agent identifier
            - capacity (int, optional): Maximum number of tasks (default 1)
            - skills (list, optional): Skills this agent possesses
            - cost_multiplier (float, optional): Cost multiplier (default 1.0)
            - metadata (dict, optional): Additional context
        tasks: List of tasks to be assigned, each with:
            - id (str): Unique task identifier
            - required_skills (list, optional): Skills required for this task
            - duration (int, optional): Task duration/workload (default 1)
            - priority (int, optional): Task priority (default 1)
            - metadata (dict, optional): Additional context
        cost_matrix: Optional cost matrix where [i][j] = cost to assign task i to agent j.
                    If not provided, uses agent.cost_multiplier * task.duration
        objective: Optimization goal - 'minimize_cost', 'maximize_assignments', or 'balance_load'
        force_assign_all: If True, all tasks must be assigned (infeasible if not possible).
                         If False, some tasks can remain unassigned.
        max_time_ms: Maximum solver time in milliseconds (default 60000)

    Returns:
        SolveAssignmentProblemResponse containing:
            - status: Solution status
            - assignments: List of task-to-agent assignments
            - unassigned_tasks: Tasks that could not be assigned
            - agent_load: Number of tasks assigned to each agent
            - total_cost: Total cost of all assignments
            - solve_time_ms: Actual solve time
            - optimality_gap: Gap from best bound
            - explanation: Human-readable summary

    Tips for LLMs:
        - For task assignment: agents are workers/machines, tasks are jobs/work items
        - For matching: agents are resources, tasks are requests to match
        - Skills create hard constraints (incompatible if skills don't match)
        - Use minimize_cost for cost-optimal assignments
        - Use maximize_assignments when some tasks are optional
        - Use balance_load to distribute work evenly across agents

        response = await solve_assignment_problem(
            agents=[
                {"id": "worker_1", "capacity": 2, "cost_multiplier": 1.0},

            ],
            objective="minimize_cost"
        )
        # Returns cost-optimal assignment respecting capacity

                {"id": "dev_1", "capacity": 3, "skills": ["python", "docker"]},
