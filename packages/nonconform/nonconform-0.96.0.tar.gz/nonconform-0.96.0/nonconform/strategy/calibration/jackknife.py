class Jackknife(BaseStrategy):
    """Jackknife (leave-one-out) conformal anomaly detection strategy.

    This strategy implements conformal prediction using the jackknife method,
    which is a special case of k-fold cross-validation where k equals the
    number of samples in the dataset (leave-one-out). For each sample, a
    model is trained on all other samples, and the left-out sample is used
    for calibration.

    It internally uses a :class:`~nonconform.strategy.cross_val.CrossValidation`
    strategy, dynamically setting its `_k` parameter to the dataset size.

    Attributes:
        _plus (bool): If ``True``, each model trained (one for each left-out
            sample) is retained. If ``False``, a single model trained on the
            full dataset (after leave-one-out calibration) is retained. This
            behavior is delegated to the internal `CrossValidation` strategy.
        _strategy (CrossValidation): An instance of the
            :class:`~nonconform.strategy.cross_val.CrossValidation` strategy,
            configured for leave-one-out behavior.
        _calibration_ids (list[int] | None): Indices of the samples from
            the input data `x` used for calibration. Populated after
            :meth:`fit_calibrate` and accessible via :attr:`calibration_ids`.
            Initially ``None``.
        _detector_list (List[AnomalyDetector]): A list of trained detector models,
            populated by :meth:`fit_calibrate` via the internal strategy.
        _calibration_set (numpy.ndarray): An array of calibration scores, one for
            each sample, populated by :meth:`fit_calibrate` via the internal
            strategy.
