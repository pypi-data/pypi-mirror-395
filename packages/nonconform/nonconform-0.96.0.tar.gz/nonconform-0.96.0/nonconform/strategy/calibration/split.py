class Split(BaseStrategy):
    """Split conformal strategy for fast anomaly detection with statistical guarantees.

    Implements the classical split conformal approach by dividing training data into
    separate fitting and calibration sets. This provides the fastest conformal inference
    at the cost of using less data for calibration compared to other strategies.

    Example:
        ```python
        from nonconform.strategy import Split

        # Use 20% of data for calibration
        strategy = Split(n_calib=0.2)

        # Use exactly 1000 samples for calibration
        strategy = Split(n_calib=1000)
        ```

    Attributes:
        _calib_size: Size or proportion of data used for calibration.
        _calibration_ids: Indices of calibration samples (for weighted conformal).
