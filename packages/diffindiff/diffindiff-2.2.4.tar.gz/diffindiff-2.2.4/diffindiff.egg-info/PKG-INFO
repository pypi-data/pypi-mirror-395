# diffindiff: Difference-in-Differences (DiD) Analysis Python Library

This Python library is designed for performing Difference-in-Differences (DiD) analyses in a convenient way. It allows users to construct datasets, define treatment and control groups, and set treatment periods. DiD model analyses may be conducted with both datasets created by built-in functions and ready-to-use external datasets. Both simultaneous and staggered adoption are supported. The library allows for various extensions, such as two-way fixed effects models, group- or individual-specific effects, post-treatment periods, and triple-difference estimations. Additionally, it includes functions for visualizing results, such as plotting DiD coefficients with confidence intervals and illustrating the temporal evolution of staggered treatments. Furthermore, several functions for rigorous treatment setting and data diagnostics are incorporated.

## Updates v2.2.4
- Bugfixes:
  - Spillover treatment really really works now (only relevant in rare cases)
  - Fixed merging in diddata.DiffData.add_covariates() (only relevant in rare cases)
  - Dropping missing values consequently (only relevant in rare cases)


## Features

- **Data preparation and pre-analysis**: 
  - Define custom treatment and control groups as well as treatment periods
  - Create ready-to-fit DiD data objects
  - Create predictive counterfactuals
- **DiD analysis**: 
  - Perfom standard DiD analysis  
  - Model extensions:
    - Staggered adoption
    - Multiple treatments
    - Two-way fixed effects models
    - Group- or individual-specific treatment effects
    - Group- or individual-specific time trends
    - Including covariates
    - Including after-treatment period
    - Triple Difference (DDD)
    - Own counterfactuals
    - Bonferroni correction for treatment effects
    - Placebo test
- **Visualization**:
  - Plot observed and expected time course of treatment and control group
  - Plot expected time course of treatment group and counterfactual
  - Plot model coefficients with confidence intervals
  - Plot individual or group-specific treatment effects with confidence intervals
  - Visualize the temporal evolution of staggered treatments
- **Diagnosis tools**:
  - Test for control conditions
  - Test for type of adoption
  - Test whether the panel dataset is balanced
  - Test for parallel trend assumption
