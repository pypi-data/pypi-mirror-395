Ever wonder how you *really* spent your day? Time Guardian silently captures screenshots and uses AI to tell you exactly what you were doing—so you can finally answer the question: "Where did my afternoon go?"

## Why Time Guardian?

📸 **Automatic tracking** — Set it and forget it. Screenshots every 5 seconds, intelligently filtered.  
🧠 **AI-powered analysis** — AI Vision understands what you're doing, not just which app is open.  
📊 **Honest reports** — See breakdowns by app, activity type, and get AI-generated summaries.  
🔒 **Privacy-first** — Everything runs locally. Your screenshots and data stay on your machine.

## Installation

```bash
pip install time-guard
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Start tracking (runs until you stop it)
time-guardian track

# Generate a report of your activity
time-guardian summary
```

That's it. Time Guardian will capture screenshots, analyze them with AI, and show you where your time went.

## Usage

### Tracking

```bash
# Track indefinitely (Ctrl+C to stop)
time-guardian track

# Track for 1 hour
time-guardian track --duration 60

# Custom interval (every 10 seconds instead of 5)
time-guardian track --duration 60 --interval 10

# Track without AI analysis (just screenshots)
time-guardian track --no-ai
```

Screenshots are saved to `~/.time-guardian/screenshots` by default.

### Reports & Analysis

```bash
# View activity summary
time-guardian summary

# Analyze a specific screenshot directory
time-guardian analyze-screenshots -s ./my-screenshots

# Check version
time-guardian version
```

### Utility Commands

```bash
# Verify screen recording permissions work
time-guardian check-permissions

# Take a single screenshot
time-guardian screenshot -o snapshot.png

# See connected monitors
time-guardian monitors

# List visible windows
time-guardian windows

# List running processes
time-guardian processes
```

```

1. **Capture** — Screenshots taken every N seconds across all monitors
2. **Compare** — Only saves when screen content actually changes
3. **Classify** — GPT-4 Vision analyzes each window to determine activity
4. **Report** — Aggregates data into human-readable summaries
