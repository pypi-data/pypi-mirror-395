    """Compute new coordinates for the scope to track the zebrafish lateral
    line primordium's movement based on a 2D or 3D image. The primordium is
    masked using object-count thresholding. The new y (and z, if 3D) positions
    are computed as the respective centers of mass of the mask. The new x
    position is computed relative to the leading edge position of the mask.

    Note: This was developed for and (mainly) tested on the cldnb:EGFP line.
    While it has been used for some other lines with adjusted parameters, it is
    absolutely not guaranteed to work universally.

    Parameters
    ----------
    target_path : str
        Path to the image file that is to be analyzed.
    channel : int, optional, default None
        Index of channel to use for masking in case of multi-channel images.
        If not specified, a single-channel image is assumed.
    gauss_sigma : float, optional, default 3.0
        Sigma for Gaussian filter prior to masking.
    count_reduction : float, optional, default 0.5
        Factor by which object count has to be reduced below its initial peak
        for a threshold value to be accepted.
    blank_fract : float, optional, default 1.0/5.0
        Distance of the leading edge from the right-hand border of the image
        after the correction, expressed as a fraction of the image size in x.
    default_catchup_fract : float, optional, default 1.0/5.0
        Catch-up distance by which the field of view should be moved if the
        mask touches the right-hand border of the image, expressed as a
        fraction of the image size in x.
    default_step_fract : float, optional, default 1.0/8.0
        Default distance by which the field of view should be moved if masking
        appears to have failed (leading edge in rear half of image), expressed
        as a fraction of the image size in x.
    await_write : int, optional, default 2
        Seconds to wait between each check of the target file size to determine
        if the file is still being written to. Reducing this will shave off
        latency but increases the risk of race conditions.
    warn_8bit : bool, optional, default True
        Whether to emit a warning when a non-8bit image was found and was down-
        converted to 8bit using min-max rescaling.
    show : bool, optional, default False
        Whether to show the threshold plot and the mask. Default is False.
        Note that figures will be shown without blocking execution, so if many
        iterations are performed, many figures will be opened. Also, note that
        all figures will be closed when the python process exits.
    verbose : bool, optional, default False
        If True, more information is printed.

    Returns
    -------
    z_pos, y_pos, x_pos : floats
        New coordinates for the next acquisition. For 2D inputs, z_pos is 0.0.
    img_msg : "_"
        A string output message; required by DySTrack but here unused and just
        set to "_".
    img_cache : {}
        A dictionary to be passed as keyword arguments to future calls to the
        pipeline; required by DySTrack but here unused and just set to {}.
