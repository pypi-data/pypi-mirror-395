def robustly_load_image_after_write(target_path, await_write=2):
    """Load an image from a specified target path using bioio, ensuring (as)
    (best as possible using simple means) that the image is no longer being
    actively written out by the microscope.

    Works by repeatedly checking the target file size and initiating the load
    only if the size has not increased for at least 2 seconds. Loading itself
    is attempted multiple times in case it fails for some reason.

    Currently supported file types:
        - `["tif", "tiff", "czi", "nd2"]`

    Parameters
    ----------
    target_path : path-like
        Path to the image file that is to be analyzed.
    await_write : int, optional, default 2
        Seconds to wait between each check of the target file size to determine
        if the file is still being written to. Reducing this will shave off
        latency but increases the risk of race conditions.

    Returns
    -------
    raw : numpy array
        Loaded image data.
