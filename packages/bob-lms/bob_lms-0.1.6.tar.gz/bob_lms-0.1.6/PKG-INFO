# B.O.B – Python CLI Library Management System (`bob-lms`)

[![PyPI version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/bob-lms)](https://pypi.org/project/bob-lms/)
[![Python Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.8%2B-blue)](https://www.python.org/)

**B.O.B** (short for *Books on Board*) is a Python-based Command-Line Interface (CLI) Library Management System designed for simplicity, flexibility, and efficiency. It allows users to manage books, track users, and maintain library operations directly from the terminal — ideal for personal, educational, or small-scale library setups.

Built with a focus on **modular architecture, clean code, and scalability**, B.O.B is perfect for developers looking to expand CLI tooling and for users who want a lightweight library system without heavy databases or GUIs.
