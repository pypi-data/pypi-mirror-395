			:param window_function:
				- RECTangular: The rectangular window has the best frequency resolution, but a poor amplitude accuracy and is recommended for separating two tones with almost equal amplitudes and a small frequency distance.
				- HAMMing: The Hamming window is bell shaped and has a good frequency resolution and fair amplitude accuracy. It is recommended for frequency response measurements and sine waves, periodic signals and narrowband noise.
				- HANN: The Hann window is bell shaped and has a slightly worse frequency resolution but smaller sidelobe level than the Hamming window. The applications are the same.
				- BLACkharris: The Blackman window is bell shaped and has a poor frequency resolution, but very good amplitude accuracy. It is recommended mainly for signals with single frequencies to detect harmonics.
				- GAUSsian: Good frequency resolution and best magnitude resolution, recommended for weak signals and short duration
				- FLATTOP2: The flat top window has a poor frequency resolution, but the best amplitude accuracy and the sharpest sidelobe. It is recommended for accurate single tone amplitude measurements.
				- KAISerbessel: The kaiser-bessel window has a fair frequency resolution and good amplitude accuracy, and a very high sidelobe level. It is recommended for separating two tones with differing amplitudes and a small frequency distance.
