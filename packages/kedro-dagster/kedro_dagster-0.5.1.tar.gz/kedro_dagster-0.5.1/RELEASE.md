# Release 0.5.0

## Major features and improvements

- Add comprehensive logging throughout the translation process with `LOGGER.info()` for major steps and `LOGGER.debug()` for detailed progress tracking by @gtauzin.
- Add FAQ documentation page with common questions, troubleshooting guides, and production deployment considerations by @gtauzin.
- Expand user guide documentation with detailed `DagsterPartitionedDataset` usage examples and migration guides by @gtauzin.
- Restrict `DagsterPartitionedDataset` to only support `StaticPartitionsDefinition`, `StaticPartitionMapping`, and `IdentityPartitionMapping` with clear validation errors for unsupported partition types by @gtauzin.

## Bug fixes and other changes

- Fix missing `after_catalog_created` hook invocation in Dagster job execution by @gtauzin.
- Pass catalog directly to translators instead of accessing via context to avoid potential stale catalog references by @gtauzin.
- Improve error messages throughout the codebase with better context and available options by @gtauzin.
- Add detailed property docstrings to `KedroRunResource` for better API documentation by @gtauzin.
- Rename Technical documentation to User guide and update links accordingly by @gtauzin.

## Breaking changes to the API

- `KedroRunTranslator` now requires `catalog` as an explicit parameter instead of accessing it from `context.catalog` by @gtauzin.
- `PipelineTranslator` now requires `catalog` as an explicit parameter instead of accessing it from `context.catalog` by @gtauzin.
- `DagsterPartitionedDataset` now raises `NotImplementedError` at instantiation for unsupported partition types (`TimeWindowPartitionsDefinition`, `MultiPartitionsDefinition`, `DynamicPartitionsDefinition`) instead of at runtime by @gtauzin.
- `DagsterPartitionedDataset` now raises `NotImplementedError` at instantiation for unsupported partition mappings (anything other than `StaticPartitionMapping` and `IdentityPartitionMapping`) by @gtauzin.

# Release 0.4.0

## Major features and improvements
- Wrap all Dagster `dg` CLI commands to be run from within a Kedro project with `kedro dagster <dg command>` by @gtauzin.
- Add a `kedro_dagster.logging` module meant to replace `logging` imports in Kedro nodes so loggers are captured and integrated with Dagster by @gtauzin.
- Add `loggers` section to `dagster.yml` configuration file to configure Dagster run loggers by @gtauzin.
- Rename `LoggerTranslator` to `LoggerCreator` for consistency with `ExecutorCreator` and `SchedulerCreator` by @gtauzin.
- Declare direct dependency on `pydantic>=1.0.0,<3.0.0` and enable version-agnostic Pydantic configuration by @gtauzin.
- Add conda-forge support for Kedro-Dagster, allowing installation with `conda` or `mamba` by @rxm7706 and @gtauzin.
- Allow setting `group_name` in a dataset's `metadata` to override the pipeline-derived group name; `group_name` is also applied per-AssetOut for multi-assets so each asset can have an individual group by @gtauzin.
- Add links to MLflow run in Dagster run logs, run tags, and materialized asset metadata by @gtauzin.

## Bug fixes and other changes
- Fix how `LoggerCreator` creates loggers for Dagster runs. Generic logging configuration is now supported from `dagster.yml` by @gtauzin.

## Breaking changes to the API
- Make `env` a required parameter of `KedroProjectTranslator` by @gtauzin.
- Remove `dev` config in `dagster.yml` by @gtauzin.

- Enable fanning out Kedro nodes when creating the Dagster graph when using `DagsterPartitionedDataset` with multiple partition keys by @gtauzin.
- Add support for Kedro >= 1.0.0 and Dagster >= 1.12.0 by @gtauzin.

## Bug fixes and other changes
