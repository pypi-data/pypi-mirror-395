## What is Kedro-Dagster?

The Kedro-Dagster plugin enables seamless integration between [Kedro](https://kedro.readthedocs.io/), a framework for creating reproducible and maintainable data science code, and [Dagster](https://dagster.io/), a data orchestrator for machine learning and data pipelines. This plugin makes use of Dagster's orchestration capabilities to automate and monitor Kedro pipelines effectively.

Currently, Kedro-Dagster supports Kedro versions 0.19.x and 1.x, and Dagster versions 1.10.x, 1.11.x, and 1.12.x.

## What are the features of Kedro-Dagster?

- **Configuration‑driven workflows:** Centralize orchestration settings in a `dagster.yml` file for each Kedro environment. Define jobs from filtered Kedro pipelines, assign executors, schedules.
- **Customization:** The core integration lives in the auto‑generated Dagster `definitions.py`. For advanced use cases, you can extend or override these definitions.
- **Kedro hooks preservation:** Kedro hooks are preserved and called at the appropriate time during pipeline execution, so custom logic (e.g., data validation, logging) continues to work seamlessly.
- **MLflow compatibility:** Use [Kedro-MLflow](https://github.com/Galileo-Galilei/kedro-mlflow) with Dagster’s [MLflow integration](https://dagster.io/integrations/dagster-mlflow) to track experiments, log models, and register artifacts.
- **Logger integration:** Unifies Kedro and Dagster logging so logs from Kedro nodes appear in the Dagster UI and are easy to trace and debug. Additionally, provides configuration to customize Dagster run loggers.
- **(Experimental) Dagster partition support:** Make use of Dagster's partitions to fan-out Kedro nodes acting on partitioned data.

## How to install Kedro-Dagster?

Install the Kedro-Dagster plugin using `pip`:

```bash
pip install kedro-dagster
```

or using `uv`:

```bash
uv pip install kedro-dagster
```

or using `conda`:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge kedro-dagster
```

or using `mamba`:

```bash
mamba install -c conda-forge kedro-dagster
```

or alternatively, add `kedro-dagster` to your `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` file.

## How to get started with Kedro-Dagster?

1. **Initialize the plugin in your Kedro project**

Use the following command to generate a `definitions.py` file, where all translated Kedro objects are available as Dagster objects, and a `dagster.yml` configuration file:

```bash
kedro dagster init --env <ENV_NAME>
```

2. **Configure jobs, executors, and schedules**

Define your job executors and schedules in the `dagster.yml` configuration file located in your Kedro project's `conf/<ENV_NAME>` directory. This file allows you to filter Kedro pipelines and assign specific executors and schedules to them.

```yaml
# conf/local/dagster.yml
schedules:
  daily: # Schedule name
    cron_schedule: "0 0 * * *" # Schedule parameters

executors: # Executor name
  sequential: # Executor parameters
    in_process:

  multiprocess:
    multiprocess:
      max_concurrent: 2

jobs:
  default: # Job name
    pipeline: # Pipeline filter parameters
      pipeline_name: __default__
    executor: sequential

  parallel_data_processing:
    pipeline:
      pipeline_name: data_processing
      node_names:
      - preprocess_companies_node
      - preprocess_shuttles_node
    schedule: daily
    executor: multiprocess

  data_science:
    pipeline:
      pipeline_name: data_science
    schedule: daily
    executor: sequential
```

3. **Launch the Dagster UI**

Start the Dagster UI to monitor and manage your pipelines using the following command:

```bash
kedro dagster dev --env <ENV_NAME>
```

The Dagster UI will be available at http://127.0.0.1:3000.

For a concrete use-case, see the [Kedro-Dagster example repository](https://github.com/gtauzin/kedro-dagster-example).
