# storageCat - Fun sciCat archival
A lightweight package to make the archival process to [sciCat](https://www.scicatproject.org/) a breeze. Instead of building your metadata file by hand - this package asks you a series of questions through the cli and then builds it for you.

## Installation and Usage

pip install storageCat
storageCat create

#    |\---/|
