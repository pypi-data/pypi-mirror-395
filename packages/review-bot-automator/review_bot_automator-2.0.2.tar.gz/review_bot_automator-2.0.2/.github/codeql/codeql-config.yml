# CodeQL Configuration for Python Security Analysis
# ============================================================================
# This configuration optimizes CodeQL analysis for the Python codebase by:
# 1. Using enhanced security query suites for comprehensive coverage
# 2. Focusing analysis on production code (src/)
# 3. Excluding test files and documentation from analysis
# 4. Filtering out common false positives for Python projects
#
# Related: Issue #43 - Optimize CodeQL Analysis Performance

name: "Python Security Analysis Configuration"

# Use default queries as a baseline, then add extended suites
disable-default-queries: false

# Query suites to run for comprehensive security coverage
queries:
  # Security-extended: Enhanced security queries including additional patterns
  # Covers: CWE top 25, OWASP top 10, and GitHub-specific security patterns
  - uses: security-extended

  # Security-and-quality: Combines security with code quality checks
  # Helps identify maintainability issues that could lead to security bugs
  - uses: security-and-quality

# Path filters: Focus analysis on production source code
paths:
  - src/review_bot_automator/

# Paths to ignore: Exclude non-production code from analysis
# This improves performance and reduces false positives
paths-ignore:
  - tests/              # Test files (covered by test security scanning)
  - docs/               # Documentation files
  - scripts/            # Build and utility scripts
  - "**/*.md"           # Markdown documentation
  - "**/*.txt"          # Text files (requirements, etc.)
  - "**/__pycache__/"   # Python cache directories
  - "**/*.pyc"          # Compiled Python files
  - ".github/"          # GitHub workflow files
  - "*.egg-info/"       # Package metadata
  - "dist/"             # Distribution files
  - "build/"            # Build artifacts
  - ".venv/"            # Virtual environment
  - "htmlcov/"          # Coverage reports

# Query filters: Fine-tune analysis results
# These filters help reduce false positives specific to Python projects
query-filters:
  # Exclude queries with common false positives in Python CLI apps

  # Clear-text logging: Often necessary for CLI debugging output
  # Our logging uses structured logging and sanitizes sensitive data
  - exclude:
      id: py/clear-text-logging-sensitive-data
      reason: "CLI application with controlled logging of non-sensitive data"

  # Clear-text storage: Config files often need to be human-readable
  # Secrets are handled via environment variables, not stored in code
  - exclude:
      id: py/clear-text-storage-sensitive-data
      reason: "Configuration stored in files, secrets use environment variables"

# Additional configuration for Python-specific analysis
# CodeQL automatically detects Python version and handles dependencies
# No build or dependency installation required for Python static analysis
