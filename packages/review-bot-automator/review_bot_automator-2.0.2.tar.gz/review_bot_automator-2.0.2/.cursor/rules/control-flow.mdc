# Control Flow Best Practices

## Priority Systems

### Use if/elif Chains for Mutually Exclusive Priorities

When implementing priority systems, use if/elif chains to prevent lower priorities from overriding higher ones:

❌ WRONG (sequential ifs allow overwriting):
```python
priority = base_priority

if is_user_selection():
    priority = 100  # Highest

if is_security_fix():
    priority = 90  # Could override user selection!

if is_formatting():
    priority = 10  # Could override everything!
```

✅ CORRECT (if/elif prevents overwriting):
```python
priority = base_priority

if is_user_selection():
    priority = 100  # Highest, cannot be overridden
elif is_security_fix():
    priority = 90  # Only if not user selection
elif is_syntax_fix():
    priority = 80
elif is_formatting():
    priority = 10

# Apply adjustments AFTER priority determination
priority += author_adjustment()
```

### Priority System Rules
1. Order conditions from highest to lowest priority
2. Use if/elif/else chain (not sequential ifs)
3. Apply modifiers AFTER base priority determination
4. Document priority values clearly
5. Test boundary cases

### Review Checklist
- [ ] Priority conditions use if/elif chain
- [ ] Conditions ordered highest to lowest
- [ ] No sequential ifs that could overwrite
- [ ] Adjustments applied after base determination
- [ ] Tests verify priority ordering
