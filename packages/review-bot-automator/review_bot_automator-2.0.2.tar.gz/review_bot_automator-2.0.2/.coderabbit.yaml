  # Repo-aware instructions
  path_instructions:
    - path: "src/review_bot_automator/**/*.py"
      instructions: |
        Enforce Python 3.12+ best practices, strict type hints, and Google-style docstrings.
        Verify handler pattern implementation (BaseHandler inheritance) for file type handlers.
        Verify strategy pattern implementation (ResolutionStrategy) for conflict resolution.
        Ensure dataclasses are used for data models (Change, Conflict, Resolution, ResolutionResult).
        Check for proper error handling with specific exception types and context.
        Validate GitHub API integration correctness, timeout handling, and retry logic.
        Flag potential issues with conflict detection algorithms, fingerprinting, and overlap calculations.
        Ensure priority-based resolution logic is deterministic and well-tested.
        Prefer Ruff rules; flag performance pitfalls in conflict analysis loops.

    - path: "src/review_bot_automator/handlers/**/*.py"
      instructions: |
        Verify handler correctly implements BaseHandler interface (can_handle, apply_change, validate_change, detect_conflicts).
        Check file-type specific logic (JSON key merging, YAML comment preservation, TOML section handling).
        Ensure proper backup and rollback mechanisms are in place.
        Validate change application is atomic and safe (no partial writes).
        Flag missing validation or error handling for malformed files.

    - path: "src/review_bot_automator/strategies/**/*.py"
      instructions: |
        Verify strategy implements ResolutionStrategy interface correctly.
        Check priority calculation logic is deterministic and documented.
        Ensure semantic merging logic handles edge cases (overlapping ranges, nested changes).
        Validate conflict resolution decisions are well-reasoned and traceable.
        Flag potential infinite loops or performance issues in resolution algorithms.

    - path: "src/review_bot_automator/integrations/**/*.py"
      instructions: |
        Verify GitHub API usage follows best practices (authentication, rate limiting, pagination).
        Check proper timeout and retry configuration for API calls.
        Ensure comment parsing handles different formats (suggestions, diffs, multi-options).
        Validate error handling for API failures, network issues, and malformed responses.
        Flag hard-coded tokens or secrets; ensure proper environment variable usage.

    - path: "tests/**/*.py"
      instructions: |
        Enforce pytest conventions (test_*, Test*, fixtures from conftest.py).
        Verify 80%+ test coverage for new code, focus on critical paths.
        Check proper use of fixtures, mocking, and parametrized tests.
        Ensure test isolation (no shared state, proper cleanup).
        Validate edge cases and error conditions are tested.
        Flag missing tests for new handlers, strategies, or conflict detection logic.

    - path: ".github/**/*"
      instructions: |
        Verify least-privilege permissions, pinned actions SHAs, secret usage, concurrency/cancellation.
        Suggest caching and optimization where build times benefit.
        Ensure CI runs linting (Black, Ruff, MyPy), tests, security checks (Bandit, Safety).
        Validate proper matrix strategy for Python 3.12.x.
        Check proper artifact upload and coverage reporting.

    - path: "{pyproject.toml,requirements*.txt,setup-dev.sh,setup-dev.ps1}"
      instructions: |
        Flag vulnerable or unpinned dependencies; suggest safer alternatives.
        Check tool configurations (ruff, mypy, pytest, coverage, bandit) for completeness.
        Verify Python 3.12 compatibility and latest stable package versions.
        Ensure development dependencies include all necessary type stubs.

    - path: "docs/**"
      instructions: |
        Verify Sphinx configuration correctness (autodoc, type hints, theme).
        Check documentation is up-to-date with code changes.
        Ensure API reference generation from docstrings works properly.
        Validate cross-references and links are not broken.
