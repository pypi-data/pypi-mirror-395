# gramps-ez-mcp

An easy-to-use MCP (Model Context Protocol) server to interact with Gramps genealogy family trees. This package provides a bridge between AI assistants and your Gramps database, enabling natural language queries about your family tree.

## Installation

Install the package using pip:

```bash
pip install gramps-ez-mcp
```

## Overview

`gramps-ez-mcp` is an MCP server that exposes your Gramps genealogy database through a standardized protocol. It allows AI assistants and chatbots to query and explore your family tree data using natural language.

The server provides tools for:
- Searching for people by name
- Retrieving person details (birth, death, events, etc.)
- Navigating family relationships (parents, children, spouses)
- Accessing family and event information
- Querying the home person

## Configuration

### Basic Configuration

The MCP server can be configured using command-line arguments or through MCP client configuration files.

#### Command-Line Usage

```bash
gramps-ez-mcp DBNAME [OPTIONS]
```

**Arguments:**
- `DBNAME`: Name of the Gramps database tree to open (required)

**Options:**
- `--transport {stdio,sse}`: Transport method to use (default: `stdio`)
- `--host HOST`: Host for SSE transport (default: `localhost`)
- `--port PORT`: Port for SSE transport (default: `8000`)

**Examples:**

```bash
# Use stdio transport with a database
gramps-ez-mcp "Gramps Example"

# Specify a custom database name
gramps-ez-mcp "My Family Tree"

# Use SSE transport on a custom port
gramps-ez-mcp "Gramps Example" --transport sse --port 9000
```

### MCP Client Configuration

For use with MCP-compatible clients (like `ez-mc-chatbot`), create a configuration file:

**Example: `ez-config.json`**

```json
{
  "model": "openai/gpt-4o-mini",
  "model_parameters": {
    "temperature": 0.0
  },
  "mcp_servers": [
    {
      "name": "gramps-ez-mcp",
      "description": "Gramps EZ MCP server for genealogy chats",
      "command": "gramps-ez-mcp",
      "args": ["Gramps Example"]
    }
  ]
}
```

Replace `"Gramps Example"` with your actual Gramps database name.

## Usage Examples

### Using with ez-mc-chatbot

The `ez-mc-chatbot` is a command-line chatbot that can interact with MCP servers. Here's how to use it with `gramps-ez-mcp`:

1. **Install ez-mc-chatbot** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   pip install ez-mc-chatbot
   ```

2. **Create a configuration file** (e.g., `examples/ez-config.json`):
   ```json
   {
     "model": "openai/gpt-4o-mini",
     "model_parameters": {
       "temperature": 0.0
     },
     "mcp_servers": [
       {
         "name": "gramps-ez-mcp",
         "description": "Gramps EZ MCP server for genealogy chats",
         "command": "gramps-ez-mcp",
         "args": ["Gramps Example"]
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

3. **Run the chatbot**:
   ```bash
   ez-mc-chatbot --config examples/ez-config.json
   ```

4. **Example queries you can ask**:
   - "Who is the home person in my family tree?"
   - "Search for people named John Smith"
   - "What is his birth date?"
   - "Who are the children of John?"
   - "Find the mother of Sarah Anderson"
