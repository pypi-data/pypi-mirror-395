           TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
        
           1. Definitions.
        
              "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
              and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
        
              "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity granting the License.
        
              "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
              other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
              control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
              "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
              direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
              otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
              outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
        
              "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity

              (which shall not include communications that are clearly marked or
              otherwise designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Work").
        
              "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based upon (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and derivative works thereof.

              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to

              systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf
              of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work,
              but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
              designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Work".
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to use, reproduce, modify, merge, publish,
              distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Work, and to
              permit persons to whom the Work is furnished to do so, subject to
              the following conditions:
        
              The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be
              included in all copies or substantial portions of the Work.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright notice to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Support. You may choose to offer, and to
              charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or support.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

## 🚨 Quick Reference - Common Gotchas

> **New to ampy-bus?** Read this first to avoid the most common issues!

| Issue | ❌ Wrong | ✅ Correct |
|-------|----------|------------|
| **NATS Subjects** | `ampy.dev_bars_v1_XNAS_AAPL` | `ampy.dev.bars.v1.XNAS.AAPL` |
| **Envelope Topic** | Missing `Topic` field | `Topic: "ampy.dev.bars.v1.XNAS.AAPL"` |
| **JetStream** | `nats-server` (no `-js`) | `nats-server -js` |
| **Error Handling** | Ignore `PublishEnvelope` errors | Always check `err` return value |

**Most Common Errors:**
- `nats: invalid subject` → Use dots, not underscores
- `nats: no response from stream` → Set `Topic` field in envelope
- `context deadline exceeded` → Start NATS with `-js` flag

</td>
</tr>
</table>

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1️⃣ **Start a Message Broker**

```bash
# Option A: NATS with JetStream (Recommended)
docker run -d --name nats -p 4222:4222 nats:2.10 -js

# Option B: Kafka/Redpanda
docker run -d --name redpanda -p 9092:9092 -p 9644:9644 \
  redpandadata/redpanda:latest redpanda start --overprovisioned --smp 1 --memory 1G
```

### 2️⃣ **Install & Build Tools**

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/AmpyFin/ampy-bus.git
cd ampy-bus

# Build Go CLI tools
make build

# Install Python package
pip install -e .[nats]
```

### 3️⃣ **Test Basic Pub/Sub**

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT**: Use dots (.) in topics, not underscores (_). This is critical for NATS JetStream to work properly.

```bash
# ✅ Publish a message (NATS) - CORRECT format with dots
./ampybusctl pub-empty --topic ampy.prod.bars.v1.XNAS.AAPL \
  --producer yfinance-go@ingest-1 --source yfinance-go --pk XNAS.AAPL

# ✅ Subscribe to messages - CORRECT format with dots
./ampybusctl sub --subject "ampy.prod.bars.v1.>"

# ❌ WRONG - Don't use underscores like this:
# ./ampybusctl pub-empty --topic ampy.prod_bars_v1_XNAS_AAPL

# Kafka alternative
./kafkabusctl pub-empty --brokers 127.0.0.1:9092 \
  --topic ampy.prod.bars.v1.XNAS.AAPL \
  --producer yfinance-go@ingest-1 --source yfinance-go --pk XNAS.AAPL
```

**Validation Steps:**
1. **Check NATS is running with JetStream:**
   ```bash
   docker logs nats | grep "Starting JetStream"
   ```

2. **Verify your topic format:**
   ```bash
   # ✅ Good: ampy.prod.bars.v1.XNAS.AAPL
   # ❌ Bad:  ampy.prod_bars_v1_XNAS_AAPL
   ```

3. **Test the connection:**
   ```bash
   # This should work without errors
   ./ampybusctl pub-empty --topic test.message --producer test@cli --source test --pk test
   ```

### 4️⃣ **Try Python Integration**

```bash
# Run Python example
python python/examples/simple_roundtrip.py
```

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Common Configuration Gotchas

> **🚨 IMPORTANT**: These configuration issues cause the most problems for new users. Read this section carefully before starting!

### NATS Subject Patterns - Use Dots, Not Underscores!

**❌ WRONG - This will fail:**
```bash
# Using underscores in subjects
./ampybusctl pub-empty --topic ampy.dev_bars_v1_XNAS_AAPL
```

**✅ CORRECT - This works:**
```bash
# Using dots in subjects (required for NATS JetStream wildcards)
./ampybusctl pub-empty --topic ampy.dev.bars.v1.XNAS.AAPL
```

**Why?** NATS JetStream wildcards (`>`) work with dots but not underscores. The library requires dots for proper subject matching.

### Envelope Topic Field - Must Be Set!

**❌ WRONG - This will fail:**
```go
envelope := ampybus.Envelope{
    // Topic field missing - this causes "no response from stream" errors
    Headers: ampybus.Headers{...},
    Payload: data,
}
```

**✅ CORRECT - This works:**
```go
envelope := ampybus.Envelope{
    Topic: "ampy.dev.bars.v1.XNAS.AAPL",  // CRITICAL: Must be set!
    Headers: ampybus.Headers{...},
    Payload: data,
}
```

### Consumer Name Limitations

Consumer names cannot contain dots, but the library handles this automatically:
```go
// Library automatically converts:
// "ampy.bars.v1.Bar" -> "ampy_bars_v1_Bar" for consumer names
```

### Stream Configuration Must Match

Your stream subjects pattern must match your publish subjects exactly:
```go
config := natsbinding.Config{
    URLs:          []string{"nats://localhost:4222"},
    StreamName:    "AMPY_TRADING",
    Subjects:      []string{"ampy.dev.>"},   // Must use dots for wildcard
    DurablePrefix: "ampy-trading",           // Consumer prefix
}
```

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: NATS JetStream Requirement

**ampy-bus requires NATS with JetStream enabled** for all NATS-based operations. Without JetStream, you'll encounter errors like:

```
Failed to ensure stream: nats: no responders available for request
```

### Quick NATS Setup

**Option 1: Docker (Recommended)**
```bash
# Start NATS with JetStream enabled (REQUIRED)
docker run -d --name nats -p 4222:4222 nats:2.10 -js

# Verify JetStream is running (check logs)
docker logs nats | grep "Starting JetStream"
```

**Option 2: Local Installation**
```bash
# Install NATS server
brew install nats-server  # macOS
# or download from https://github.com/nats-io/nats-server/releases

# Start NATS with JetStream enabled (REQUIRED)
nats-server -js

# Verify JetStream is running (you should see "Starting JetStream" in the logs)
```

**Option 3: Using the CLI**
```bash
# Start with JetStream and other options
nats-server -js --store_dir /tmp/nats/jetstream --max_memory_store 1GB
```

> **Note**: The `-js` flag is essential. Without it, ampy-bus operations will fail.

### Troubleshooting JetStream Issues

**Common Error Messages:**
```bash
# Error: No JetStream enabled
Failed to ensure stream: nats: no responders available for request

# Error: JetStream not ready
nats: context deadline exceeded
```

**Solutions:**
1. **Verify JetStream is enabled**: Check logs for "Starting JetStream"
2. **Wait for startup**: JetStream takes a few seconds to initialize
3. **Check port**: Ensure NATS is running on port 4222
4. **Restart with JetStream**: Stop and restart with `-js` flag

**Verification Commands:**
```bash
# Check if JetStream is running
docker logs nats | grep "Starting JetStream"

# Test connection
nats server info

# List JetStream streams (if available)
nats stream list
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Error: `nats: invalid subject`

**Problem:** Using underscores instead of dots in NATS subjects.

**Solution:**
```bash
# ❌ Wrong - uses underscores
./ampybusctl pub-empty --topic ampy.dev_bars_v1_XNAS_AAPL

# ✅ Correct - uses dots
./ampybusctl pub-empty --topic ampy.dev.bars.v1.XNAS.AAPL
```

### Error: `nats: invalid consumer name`

**Problem:** Consumer names cannot contain dots.

**Solution:** The library handles this automatically, but if you see this error, check your configuration:
```go
// ✅ Library automatically converts dots to underscores in consumer names
// "ampy.bars.v1.Bar" -> "ampy_bars_v1_Bar"
```

### Error: `nats: subject does not match consumer`

**Problem:** Stream subjects pattern doesn't match your publish subjects.

**Solution:**
```go
// ✅ Ensure your stream pattern matches your publish subjects
config := natsbinding.Config{
    Subjects: []string{"ampy.dev.>"},  // This matches ampy.dev.bars.v1.XNAS.AAPL
}
```

### Error: `nats: no response from stream`

**Problem:** Missing `Topic` field in envelope.

**Solution:**
```go
// ❌ Wrong - Topic field missing
envelope := ampybus.Envelope{
    Headers: ampybus.Headers{...},
    Payload: data,
}

// ✅ Correct - Topic field set
envelope := ampybus.Envelope{
    Topic: "ampy.dev.bars.v1.XNAS.AAPL",  // CRITICAL!
    Headers: ampybus.Headers{...},
    Payload: data,
}
```

### Error: `nats: no responders available for request`

**Problem:** You're using request-reply pattern instead of simple publishing.

**Solution:** Use `PublishEnvelope` for simple publishing:
```go
// ✅ Use PublishEnvelope for simple publishing
_, err = bus.PublishEnvelope(context.Background(), envelope, map[string]string{})
```

### Error: `context deadline exceeded`

**Problem:** NATS server is not running or not accessible.

**Solution:**
```bash
# Start NATS with JetStream
docker run --rm -d --name nats -p 4222:4222 nats:2.10 -js

# Verify it's running
docker logs nats | grep "Starting JetStream"
```

### Error: `nats: stream not found`

**Problem:** Stream doesn't exist or wasn't created properly.

**Solution:** The library should create streams automatically, but you can verify:
```bash
# List streams
nats stream list

# Create stream manually if needed
nats stream add AMPY_TRADING --subjects "ampy.dev.>"
```

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging to troubleshoot issues:

```go
// Add debug logging to your handlers
func handleMessage(data []byte) error {
    log.Printf("🔍 DEBUG: Received message: %d bytes", len(data))
    // ... process message
    return nil
}

// Enable debug logging in configuration
config := natsbinding.Config{
    URLs:          []string{"nats://localhost:4222"},
    StreamName:    "AMPY_TRADING",
    Subjects:      []string{"ampy.dev.>"},
    DurablePrefix: "ampy-trading",
    // Add debug options if available in your version
}
```

### Quick Validation Test

Run this test to verify everything is working:

```bash
go run - << 'EOF'
package main

import (
    "context"
    "fmt"
    "log"
    "time"
    
    "github.com/AmpyFin/ampy-bus/pkg/ampybus"
    "github.com/AmpyFin/ampy-bus/pkg/ampybus/natsbinding"
)

func main() {
    config := natsbinding.Config{
        URLs:          []string{"nats://localhost:4222"},
        StreamName:    "TEST_STREAM",
        Subjects:      []string{"test.>"},
        DurablePrefix: "test-consumer",
    }
    
    bus, err := natsbinding.NewBus(config)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    defer bus.Close()
    
    envelope := ampybus.Envelope{
        Topic: "test.message",  // CRITICAL: Set Topic field
        Headers: ampybus.Headers{
            MessageID:  "test-123",
            SchemaFQDN: "test.Message",
            ProducedAt: time.Now(),
        },
        Payload: []byte("test data"),
    }
    
    _, err = bus.PublishEnvelope(context.Background(), envelope, map[string]string{})
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    
    fmt.Println("✅ ampy-bus working correctly!")
}
EOF
```

## 🎯 Best Practices & Common Pitfalls

### ✅ Do's

1. **Always set the Topic field in envelopes**
   ```go
   envelope := ampybus.Envelope{
       Topic: "ampy.dev.bars.v1.XNAS.AAPL",  // CRITICAL!
       Headers: ampybus.Headers{...},
       Payload: data,
   }
   ```

2. **Use dots in NATS subjects, not underscores**
   ```bash
   # ✅ Correct
   ./ampybusctl pub-empty --topic ampy.dev.bars.v1.XNAS.AAPL
   
   # ❌ Wrong
   ./ampybusctl pub-empty --topic ampy.dev_bars_v1_XNAS_AAPL
   ```

3. **Handle errors from PublishEnvelope**
   ```go
   _, err = bus.PublishEnvelope(context.Background(), envelope, map[string]string{})
   if err != nil {
       log.Printf("Failed to publish: %v", err)
       return err
   }
   ```

4. **Use pull subscriptions for reliability**
   ```go
   // ✅ Recommended for production
   return bus.Subscribe(subject, schemaFQDN, func(data []byte) error {
       // Process message
       return nil
   })
   ```

5. **Set appropriate DurablePrefix for consumers**
   ```go
   config := natsbinding.Config{
       DurablePrefix: "ampy-trading",  // Meaningful prefix
   }
   ```

6. **Use PartitionKey for message ordering**
   ```go
   headers := ampybus.Headers{
       PartitionKey: "XNAS.AAPL",  // Ensures ordering per symbol
   }
   ```

### ❌ Don'ts

1. **Don't forget to set Topic field**
   ```go
   // ❌ This will fail with "no response from stream"
   envelope := ampybus.Envelope{
       Headers: ampybus.Headers{...},
       Payload: data,
   }
   ```

2. **Don't use underscores in subjects**
   ```bash
   # ❌ This will fail with "invalid subject"
   ./ampybusctl pub-empty --topic ampy.dev_bars_v1_XNAS_AAPL
   ```

3. **Don't ignore errors**
   ```go
   // ❌ Don't ignore errors
   bus.PublishEnvelope(context.Background(), envelope, map[string]string{})
   
   // ✅ Always handle errors
   _, err := bus.PublishEnvelope(context.Background(), envelope, map[string]string{})
   if err != nil {
       return err
   }
   ```

4. **Don't use request-reply for simple publishing**
   ```go
   // ❌ Don't use request-reply for simple publishing
   // This will fail with "no responders available"
   
   // ✅ Use PublishEnvelope for simple publishing
   _, err = bus.PublishEnvelope(context.Background(), envelope, map[string]string{})
   ```

5. **Don't forget to close the bus**
   ```go
   // ✅ Always close the bus
   defer bus.Close()
   ```

### 🔧 Configuration Validation

Add validation to catch common mistakes early:

```go
func validateConfig(config natsbinding.Config) error {
    // Check for underscores in subjects
    for _, subject := range config.Subjects {
        if strings.Contains(subject, "_") {
            return fmt.Errorf("subjects must use dots, not underscores: %s", subject)
        }
    }
    
    // Check for empty stream name
    if config.StreamName == "" {
        return fmt.Errorf("stream name cannot be empty")
    }
    
    // Check for empty durable prefix
    if config.DurablePrefix == "" {
        return fmt.Errorf("durable prefix cannot be empty")
    }
    
    return nil
}
```

### 🚀 Performance Tips

1. **Use compression for large payloads**
   ```go
   headers := ampybus.Headers{
       ContentEncoding: "gzip",  // For payloads > 128KB
   }
   ```

2. **Batch messages when possible**
   ```go
   // Send multiple bars in a single batch
   envelope := ampybus.Envelope{
       Topic: "ampy.dev.bars.v1.XNAS.AAPL",
       Headers: ampybus.Headers{
           SchemaFQDN: "ampy.bars.v1.BarBatch",  // Batch schema
       },
       Payload: batchData,
   }
   ```

3. **Use appropriate partition keys for ordering**
   ```go
   // For bars: use symbol + mic
   PartitionKey: "XNAS.AAPL"
   
   // For orders: use client_order_id
   PartitionKey: "co_20250101_001"
   
   // For fills: use account + order
   PartitionKey: "ALPACA-LIVE-01|co_20250101_001"
   ```

## 🎯 What Problem Does This Solve?

**Trading systems need reliable, auditable messaging** but teams often end up with:
- **Schema drift** between services using different message formats
- **Inconsistent delivery semantics** (ordering, retries, dead letter queues)
- **Poor replayability** for research, backtesting, and compliance audits
- **Transport lock-in** (Kafka vs NATS) preventing system evolution
- **Scattered observability** with different metrics/logging per service

**ampy-bus solves this** by providing:
- ✅ **Transport-agnostic contracts** - same code works on NATS or Kafka
- ✅ **Standardized envelopes** with required headers for lineage and observability  
- ✅ **Domain-specific ordering** and partitioning strategies
- ✅ **Built-in DLQ, replay, and retry** semantics
- ✅ **Consistent observability** with metrics, tracing, and structured logging

## 1) Problem Statement

AmpyFin is a modular, self‑learning trading system. Teams naturally want different transports (Kafka vs NATS) and different ingestion sources (Databento C++, yfinance Go, Tiingo, Marketbeat, FX rates, etc.). Without a shared messaging contract, systems drift:
- **Schema drift & bespoke adapters** between services
- **Ambiguous delivery semantics** (ordering, idempotency, retries)
- **Poor replayability** for research and audits
- **Inconsistent metrics/logging** across services

**ampy-bus** solves this by specifying the **contract**, not the broker—so modules can be swapped or scaled independently with **zero message‑shape drift** and **predictable delivery semantics**.

---

## 2) Mission & Success Criteria

### Mission
Provide a **single, consistent messaging layer** for all AmpyFin subsystems such that modules are independently deployable and replayable.

### Success looks like
- Any producer can emit `ampy-proto` payloads with **identical envelopes and headers**; any consumer can parse them without adapters.
- Topics and headers encode **schema identity, lineage, and version**, enabling deterministic replays/audits.
- Clear **QoS tiers** and **ordering keys** by domain (e.g., `(symbol, mic)` for prices, `client_order_id` for orders).
- **Observed latency** and **throughput** meet SLOs across live and replay paths.
- **Backpressure**, **retries**, **DLQ**, and **recovery** behaviors are consistent and testable.

---

## 3) Scope (What `ampy-bus` Covers)

- **Transport‑agnostic contract** for topics, envelopes, headers, keys, ordering, retries, DLQ, replay, and observability.
- **Domain‑specific guidance**: bars, ticks, news, FX, fundamentals, corporate actions, universe, signals, orders, fills, positions, metrics.
- **Performance & SLO targets**, backpressure handling, and capacity planning guidance.
- **Security & compliance** norms for trading workloads (authn/z, TLS, PII policy, auditability).
- **Helper libraries**: Go (NATS/Kafka clients), Python helpers for envelope encode/decode and validation.

**Non‑goals**: No broker‑specific configuration or business logic. No repository layout in this README.

---

## 4) Design Principles

1. **`ampy-proto` is the source of truth** for payloads (e.g., `ampy.bars.v1.BarBatch`). No new payload shapes.
2. **Envelope wraps payload** with headers for lineage, routing, and observability.
3. **Time is UTC**. Distinguish: `event_time` (market/source), `ingest_time` (ingestion), `as_of` (logical processing time).
4. **Stable identity** via `SecurityId` where securities are referenced.
5. **Idempotency by default**: stable `message_id` (UUIDv7) plus domain `dedupe_key` when available.
6. **Compatibility**: additive evolution only within a major; breaking changes bump the payload major version (`v2` topics).
7. **Serialization**: `application/x-protobuf` (primary). Optional diagnostic JSON for human inspection only.
8. **Compression**: if payload > 128 KiB, `content_encoding="gzip"` and compress the bytes.
9. **Size limits**: target < 1 MiB; otherwise use **object‑storage pointer** pattern (§10).

---

## 5) Topic Taxonomy & Namespacing

**Canonical pattern** (slashes shown for readability; use `.` separators in broker subjects when appropriate):

```
ampy.{env}.{domain}.{version}.{subtopic}
```

- `env`: `dev` | `paper` | `prod`
- `domain`: `bars` | `ticks` | `fundamentals` | `news` | `fx` | `corporate_actions` | `universe` | `signals` | `orders` | `fills` | `positions` | `metrics` | `dlq` | `control`
- `version`: `v1`, `v2` (mirrors **payload** major version in `ampy-proto`)
- `subtopic`: domain‑specific segment(s) to enforce locality & ordering, e.g.:
  - `bars`: `{mic}.{symbol}` → `XNAS.AAPL`
  - `ticks`: `trade.{symbol}` or `quote.{symbol}`
  - `news`: `raw` or `nlp`
  - `fx`: `rates` or `{base}.{quote}`
  - `signals`: `{model_id}` (e.g., `hyper@2025-09-05`)
  - `orders`: `requests`
  - `fills`: `events`
  - `positions`: `snapshots`
  - `metrics`: `{service}`

**Examples**
- `ampy.prod.bars.v1.XNAS.AAPL`
- `ampy.paper.orders.v1.requests`
- `ampy.prod.signals.v1.hyper@2025-09-05`

> Consumers may subscribe using broker‑native wildcards/prefixes; producers should publish to concrete subjects.

---

## 6) Envelope & Headers (Contract)

Each published record = **Envelope + Payload** (`ampy-proto` bytes).

### 6.1 Required Headers

| Header | Type | Example | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `message_id` | UUIDv7 | `018F5E2F-9B1C-76AA-8F7A-3B1D8F3EA0C2` | Global unique id; sortable for time‑ordering; dedupe anchor |
| `schema_fqdn` | string | `ampy.bars.v1.BarBatch` | Exact payload message type (`ampy-proto`) |
| `schema_version` | semver | `1.0.0` | Schema minor/patch for diagnostics; major is in topic |
| `content_type` | string | `application/x-protobuf` | Serialization hint |
| `content_encoding` | string | `gzip` (or omitted) | Compression indicator |
| `produced_at` | RFC3339 UTC | `2025-09-05T19:31:01Z` | When producer created this record |
| `producer` | string | `yfinance-go@ingest-1` | Logical service instance id |
| `source` | string | `yfinance-go` \| `databento-cpp` | Upstream/source system identity |
| `run_id` | string | `live_0912` | Correlates records for a pipeline run/session |
| `trace_id` / `span_id` | W3C traceparent | `00-...` | End‑to‑end tracing |
| `partition_key` | string | `XNAS.AAPL` | Sharding/ordering key (domain‑specific) |

### 6.2 Optional Headers

- `dedupe_key` — domain idempotency key (e.g., `client_order_id`, news `id`)
- `retry_count` — incremented on republish after failure
- `dlq_reason` — set by infrastructure when routing to DLQ
- `schema_hash` — hash of compiled schema for defensive checks
- `blob_ref`, `blob_hash`, `blob_size` — pointer pattern for oversized payloads (§10)

---

## 7) Delivery Semantics, Ordering & Keys (by Domain)

> The helper libraries will implement **transport‑specific bindings** that respect these logical guarantees.

**Defaults**  
- QoS: **at‑least‑once** with **idempotent consumers**
- Ordering: guaranteed **within a partition key**

**Recommended Keys & Guarantees**

| Domain | Partition/Ordering Key | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `bars` | `(symbol, mic)` → `XNAS.AAPL` | Monotonic by `event_time` within key |
| `ticks` | `(symbol, mic)`; subtopics `trade.`/`quote.` | Extremely high‑rate; separate subtopics |
| `news` | `id` | Dedupe by `id` |
| `fx` | `(base, quote)` | Snapshot semantics; latest wins |
| `fundamentals` | `(symbol, mic, period_end, source)` | Consumers handle restatements |
| `universe` | `universe_id` | Snapshots monotonic in `as_of` |
| `signals` | `(model_id, symbol, mic, horizon)` | Latest prior to `expires_at` wins |
| `orders` | `client_order_id` | Strict causal order submit → amend/cancel |
| `fills` | `(account_id, client_order_id)` | Arrival may be out‑of‑order; accumulate |
| `positions` | `(account_id, symbol, mic)` | Monotonic `as_of` per key |
| `metrics` | `(service, metric_name)` | Counters/gauges semantics |

---

## 8) Error Handling, Retries, Backpressure, DLQ

- **Producer retries**: exponential backoff with jitter; ceilings per QoS class
- **Consumer retries**: bounded attempts; on persistent failure → **DLQ** with original headers + `dlq_reason`
- **Backpressure**: consumers signal lag (transport‑specific) → producers reduce batch size/pause low‑priority topics
- **Poison pills**: decode or contract violations → DLQ + metrics/alerts; never drop silently
- **Idempotency**: consumers dedupe by `message_id` and domain `dedupe_key` (if present)

---

## 9) Large Payloads — Object Storage Pointer Pattern

If payload exceeds thresholds:
1. Publish a **pointer envelope** with `blob_ref` (e.g., `s3://bucket/key?versionId=...`) and metadata (`blob_hash`, `blob_size`).
2. Consumers fetch object out‑of‑band, validate hash, then process.
3. Replays retain blobs for the retention window.

---

## 10) Replay & Backfill

- **Time‑window replay** for time‑series domains (bars/ticks/news/fx): specify `[start, end)` in UTC
- **Key‑scoped replay** for orders/fills/positions: by `(account_id, client_order_id)` or `(account_id, symbol, mic)`
- **Idempotent sinks**: replays must be no‑ops on previously applied effects
- **Checkpointing**: consumers persist high‑watermarks (time or offset) per key/partition
- **Retention**: ≥ 7 days live logs (prod), ≥ 30 days analytical cluster; longer for compliance domains

**Control Topic**  
`ampy.{env}.control.v1.replay_requests` carries `ampy.control.v1.ReplayRequest` payloads.

---

## 11) Observability: Metrics, Logs, Traces

**Standard Metrics (examples)**
- `bus.produced_total{topic,producer}` — counter  
- `bus.consumed_total{topic,consumer}` — counter  
- `bus.delivery_latency_ms{topic}` — histogram (p50/p95/p99)  
- `bus.batch_size_bytes{topic}` — histogram  
- `bus.consumer_lag{topic,consumer}` — gauge  
- `bus.dlq_total{topic,reason}` — counter  
- `bus.retry_total{topic,reason}` — counter  
- `bus.decode_fail_total{topic,reason}` — counter  

**Logging**  
Structured JSON with `message_id`, `trace_id`, `topic`, `producer|consumer`, `result` (ok|retry|dlq), `latency_ms`. **Do not log payloads**.

**Tracing**  
Propagate **W3C traceparent**; spans for publish, route, consume, and downstream handling.

---

## 12) Security & Compliance

- **Encryption in transit**: TLS/mTLS
- **AuthN/Z**: topic‑level ACLs (read/write); producers/consumers authenticate
- **PII policy**: forbidden in bus payloads; orders must not contain customer PII
- **Auditability**: headers + payload hashes enable forensic reconstruction
- **Secrets**: retrieved via `ampy-config` (never hardcode)
- **Tenancy**: `dev` / `paper` / `prod` namespaces

> **API keys / credentials**: None required by `ampy-bus` itself. Broker bindings will need credentials (e.g., NATS auth token or Kafka SASL), and some producers (Marketbeat, Tiingo) may need API keys. We’ll prompt for those during binding setup.

---

## 13) Performance Targets (SLOs)

- **Latency (publish → first delivery)**  
  - Orders/Signals/Fills: **p99 ≤ 50 ms** (same‑AZ)  
  - Bars/Ticks: **p99 ≤ 150 ms**
- **Payload size**: < 1 MiB (typical 32–256 KiB); compress large batches
- **Availability**: ≥ **99.9%** monthly for prod bus plane
- **Recovery**: RPO ≤ **5 min**, RTO ≤ **15 min** (documented procedures)

---

## 15) Broker Bindings (Implementation Guidance)

`ampy-bus` defines **logical** contracts. Helper libraries will implement:

### 15.1 NATS (suggested)
- Subject maps to topic (with `.` separators).  
- `partition_key` influences subject tokenization or JetStream stream sharding.  
- Headers carried via NATS message headers.  
- JetStream for durability, ack/replay, and consumer lag metrics.

### 15.2 Kafka (optional/parallel)
- Topic = `ampy.{env}.{domain}.{version}`; `subtopic` mapped to record key or additional topic segments.  
- `partition_key` used as Kafka key to guarantee per‑key order.  
- Headers map to Kafka record headers; consumer groups manage offsets/lag.

> Choose either or both. Contracts remain identical; only the binding differs.

---

## 16) Validation & Testing (What “Good” Looks Like)

- **Golden Envelopes**: ≥ 3 per domain (typical, minimal, edge/large).  
- **Cross‑language round‑trip**: Protobuf (Go/Python/C++) identical.  
- **Ordering tests**: per‑key monotonicity under concurrency.  
- **Idempotency tests**: duplicates by `message_id` and `dedupe_key` are no‑ops.  
- **Replay tests**: time‑window & key‑scoped replays do not double‑apply effects.  
- **Fault injection**: drop/duplicate/reorder/corrupt → DLQ + alerts.  
- **Load tests**: validate SLOs; backpressure signals propagate.

---

## 17) Security & Compliance Testing

- mTLS/TLS enforced; cert rotation validated.  
- ACLs: producers/consumers limited to permitted topics.  
- Audit tabletop: reconstruct a trading session from envelopes (headers + payload hashes).  
- Retention: meets policy for orders/fills compliance.

---

## 18) Acceptance Criteria (Definition of Done for v1)

1. Topic taxonomy, envelope header set, and per‑domain keys/ordering are **finalized and documented**.  
2. Golden envelope examples exist for **every domain** (≥3 each).  
3. SLO & capacity targets are documented and **validated by load tests**.  
4. Replay, DLQ, and backpressure behaviors are **proven** via fault‑injection tests.  
5. Security posture (TLS, ACLs, auditability) verified; **no PII** traverses the bus.  
6. Integration note maps each AmpyFin service to required topics and headers.

---

## 19) End‑to‑End Narrative (Cross‑Domain Flow)

1) **yfinance‑go** publishes **bars.v1** batches for `AAPL@XNAS` with `partition_key="XNAS.AAPL"`; compressed if needed.  
2) **ampy‑features** consumes bars, emits features internally, and **ampy‑model‑server** publishes **signals.v1** (`ALPHA` scores) to `signals/hyper@...`.  
3) **ampy‑ensemble** consumes multiple signals, emits final **ACTION** signals.  
4) **ampy‑oms** converts actions into **orders.v1** on `orders/requests` keyed by `client_order_id`, ensuring strict per‑order causality.  
5) **broker‑alpaca** publishes **fills.v1**, and **ampy‑position‑pnl** updates **positions.v1** snapshots.  
6) All services emit **metrics.v1**; dashboards show latency, lag, retries, and DLQ counts.  
7) If a gap is detected, an operator posts a **ReplayRequest** (control topic); consumers reprocess idempotently.

---

## 20) Integration Notes (per AmpyFin subsystem)

- **Data Ingestion**: Databento C++ (ticks), Tiingo/yfinance Go (bars/fundamentals), Marketbeat Go (news), custom FX‑rates Go client (USD/EUR/JPY/KRW etc.). All publish to bus with the same envelopes/headers.  
- **Research/ML**: feature extraction and model inference consume bars/ticks/news/fundamentals; publish `signals.v1`.  
- **Execution**: OMS consumes signals; publishes `orders.v1` and consumes `fills.v1`; positions calculated and published.  
- **Monitoring**: all services publish `metrics.v1` to a metrics sink; alerts on DLQ spikes/lag/latency.  
- **Compliance**: orders/fills/positions retained per policy; audit derives from headers and payload hashes.

---

## 21) Roadmap (post‑v1)

- **Helper SDKs**: `ampy-bus-go` and `ampy-bus-py` (envelopes, validation, tracing hooks, codecs).  
- **CLI tools**: produce/consume/replay testers; DLQ inspector.  
- **Schema registry hooks**: signature checks and schema hash enforcement.  
- **Reference bindings**: NATS JetStream and Kafka examples.  
- **Benchmarks**: publicly documented latency/throughput across brokers.

---

## 22) FAQ

**Q: Why Protobuf instead of Avro/JSON?**  
Protobuf gives compact, fast, cross‑language serialization and already underpins `ampy-proto`.

**Q: Can we use both NATS and Kafka?**  
Yes. Contracts are transport‑agnostic. Bindings map headers/keys appropriately.

**Q: Where do API keys live?**  
In each binding/producer via `ampy-config` or broker‑native secret stores. Never in code or headers.

**Q: How do we handle currency conversions/news IDs/etc.?**  
Those are **producers** (e.g., FX Go client, Marketbeat Go) that emit domain payloads. The bus contract remains unchanged.

---

## 23) Contributing

- Open an issue describing changes to topics/headers/QoS before sending PRs.  
- Include **golden envelopes** and **tests** for any new domain.  
- Follow semantic versioning for header changes (additive only) and bump payload major in topics for breaking payload changes.
