# Cross-Platform CLI fanout

This adds a `nw cli` command that opens CLI sessions to multiple devices simultaneously. The implementation adapts to your platform capabilities.

## Platform Support

### Full tmux-based fanout (Recommended)

**Platforms:** Linux, macOS, Windows with WSL

- Opens tmux session with one pane per device
- Synchronized typing across all panes
- Native tmux navigation and controls

### Sequential SSH fallback

**Platforms:** Windows (native), any system without tmux

- Opens SSH connections one by one
- No synchronized typing
- Basic cross-platform compatibility

## Requirements

### For tmux-based fanout:

- tmux installed and available
- libtmux Python package (install with `uv add libtmux` or `pip install libtmux`)
- SSH client (OpenSSH recommended)
- sshpass for password authentication (Linux/macOS: `apt install sshpass` or `brew install hudochenkov/sshpass/sshpass`)

### For sequential fallback:

- Any SSH client (OpenSSH, PuTTY plink, etc.)
- libtmux package still required (but tmux server not needed)

### Windows-specific notes:

- **Option 1 (Recommended):** Use WSL2 with tmux for full functionality
- **Option 2:** Native Windows with sequential SSH fallback
- **SSH clients supported:** Windows OpenSSH (Win10+), PuTTY plink, Git Bash SSH

## Usage

- Single device: `nw cli sw-acc1`
- Group: `nw cli office_switches`
- Custom layout: `nw cli lab_devices --layout even-vertical`
- Name session/window: `nw cli core --session-name ops --window-name core-routers`
- Disable synchronized typing: `nw cli lab_devices --no-sync`

**Synchronized typing is ENABLED by default** - your keystrokes are sent to all panes simultaneously. This is perfect for running the same commands across multiple devices. Use `--no-sync` to disable at startup.

## Synchronization Control

### At startup:

- `nw cli devices` - sync enabled (default)
- `nw cli devices --no-sync` - start with sync disabled

### Toggle during session:

**Quick toggle: Press Ctrl+b, t** - This instantly toggles sync on/off

**Manual toggle:**

1. Press Ctrl+b : (colon) to enter tmux command mode
2. Type `set synchronize-panes on` to enable or `set synchronize-panes off` to disable
3. Press Enter to execute

**Visual indicator:** When sync is enabled, all panes show a red border.

**Mouse support:** Click any pane to focus it individually.

Authentication modes:

- `--auth auto` (default): uses password auth via sshpass if a password is available from env/config; otherwise uses key-based SSH.
- `--auth key`: always uses your SSH keys/agent.
- `--auth password`: forces password auth (requires sshpass).
- `--auth interactive`: lets ssh prompt in each pane.

## Layouts

Supported tmux layouts:

- tiled (default)
- even-horizontal
- even-vertical
- main-horizontal
- main-vertical

## Keyboard shortcuts

- **Ctrl+b, z:** Zoom/unzoom focused pane (automatically exits/enters sync mode)
- **Ctrl+b + Arrow keys:** Navigate between panes
- **Ctrl+b, d:** Detach from session
- **Click any pane:** Focus that pane
- **Ctrl+b, Space:** Cycle through layouts

**Zoom behavior:** When you zoom a pane (Ctrl+b, z), it maximizes that pane and automatically exits sync mode so you can work on just that device. Press Ctrl+b, z again to unzoom and return to sync mode across all panes.

**Manual sync toggle:** Ctrl+b : then type `set synchronize-panes on` or `off` and press Enter

## Send a command to all panes

With synchronize-panes enabled (default), type any command once and press Enter - it will be sent to ALL connected devices simultaneously. This is extremely powerful for:

- Running the same configuration command across multiple devices
- Checking status on all devices at once
- Performing batch operations

**Example:** Type `/system identity print` and press Enter - this will execute on all MikroTik devices in all panes at once.

**Safety tip:** Be careful with destructive commands when sync is enabled! Consider disabling sync (`Ctrl-b : set synchronize-panes off`) for device-specific operations.

## Security note on password authentication

When password auth is used, the password is passed to `sshpass` and may appear in process lists. Prefer SSH keys for security. If you cannot use keys, consider interactive auth (`--auth interactive`) to avoid passing passwords via arguments.

Python-only alternative: We could embed an SSH client (e.g., Paramiko) to avoid `sshpass`, but then interactive TTY behavior and tmux integration get more complex. For now we keep it lean by delegating to the system `ssh`.

## tmuxp integration

This prototype keeps it slim with libtmux directly. In future we can accept a `--tmuxp` YAML to load complex layouts via tmuxp (https://tmuxp.git-pull.com/). For now, built-ins cover common needs without extra files.
