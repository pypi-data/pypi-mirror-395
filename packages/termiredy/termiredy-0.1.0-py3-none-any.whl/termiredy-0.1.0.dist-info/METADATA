# Termiredy

> A terminal tool that notifies you when your task is done.

Ever started a long-running command like a build, a data processing script, or a large file download and found yourself constantly checking the terminal to see if it's done? Termiredy is a simple wrapper for your commands that lets you know with a desktop notification the moment your task is complete.

It times your command and tells you how long it took right before sending the notification.

## Features

-   Wrap any command-line task.
-   Measures and displays the total execution time.
-   Sends a native desktop notification upon completion.
-   Supports macOS and Linux (with `notify-send`).
-   Gracefully falls back to a console message on other operating systems.

## Installation

1.  Clone this repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/bryansapo/Termiredy.git
    cd Termiredy
    ```

2.  **For Linux users:** You need to have `notify-send` installed. You can typically install it with your package manager.

    On Debian/Ubuntu:

    ```sh
    sudo apt-get install libnotify-bin
    ```

## Usage

Using Termiredy is straightforward. Just prefix your usual command with `termiredy`.

### Syntax

```sh
termiredy [your_command]
```

### Examples

1.  **Running a Python script:**

    Let's say you have a script `work.py` that takes a few seconds to run.

    ```sh
    termiredy python work.py
    ```

    Once the script finishes, you will see the total execution time in your terminal and receive a desktop notification.

2.  **Running any shell command:**

    You can use it with any command, like `sleep`.

    ```sh
    termiredy sleep 5
    ```

    After 5 seconds, you'll be notified.

### TODOs

1. **Windows Notification**
   The current version of Termiredy only support MacOS and Linux with notify-send.
2. **Email, third parties notification**
   Use Slack, Discord or other tools to notify user when the command/program is done.
