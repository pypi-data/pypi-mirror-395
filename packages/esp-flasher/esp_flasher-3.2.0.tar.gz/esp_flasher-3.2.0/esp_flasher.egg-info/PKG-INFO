# Tasmota-ESP-Flasher for Tasmota v13 and later (Safeboot partition scheme)

[![GitHub Releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/Jason2866/ESP_Flasher/total?label=downloads&color=%231FA3EC&style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/Jason2866/ESP_Flasher/releases/latest)

Tasmota-ESP-Flasher is an app for ESP8266 / ESP32 designed to make flashing Tasmota on ESPs as simple as possible by:

 * Pre-built binaries for most used operating systems
 * Support for Tasmota factory images
 * Hiding all non-essential options for flashing
 * All necessary options (bootloader, flash mode, safeboot) are set automatically
 * Flashing is lightning fast

The flashing process is done using [esptool](https://github.com/espressif/esptool) from espressif.

## Installation

after the command has fired and a relogin the Flasher can access the serial ports and flash away
