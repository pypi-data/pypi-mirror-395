"""
Gamut checking and mapping for sRGB color space.

Not all LAB colors can be represented in sRGB! Some theoretical colors
that humans can perceive simply can't be displayed on a monitor. This
module helps you:
1. Check if a LAB color is displayable (in gamut)
2. Find the nearest displayable color if it's not

The key insight: sRGB is a cube (R, G, B all 0-255), but LAB describes
a much larger volume. The intersection is the "sRGB gamut."

    """
    Check if a LAB color can be represented in sRGB without clipping.
    
    This is the fundamental question of color reproduction: "Can my monitor
    actually show this color, or will it have to fake it by clamping?"
    
    **How it works:** Convert LAB → RGB *without* clamping. If all RGB
    components are naturally in the 0-255 range (with a small tolerance),
    the color is in gamut!
    
    **Why tolerance?** Floating point math is imprecise. A value of
    255.0000001 should be considered "in gamut" even though it's technically
    over 255.
    
    **Examples of out-of-gamut colors:**
    - Super saturated colors at mid-lightness (like "laser red")
    - Colors that would need negative RGB values
    - Colors that would need RGB values > 255
    
    Args:
        lab: L*a*b* color tuple
        tolerance: How close to 0/255 boundaries before considering out-of-gamut.
                   If None, uses the global config value (default 0.01).
    
    Returns:
        True if the color can be represented in sRGB, False if it would clip
    
    Example:
        >>> is_in_srgb_gamut((50, 0, 0))  # Mid gray
        True
        >>> is_in_srgb_gamut((50, 150, 100))  # Super saturated - impossible!
        False

    """
    Find the nearest in-gamut LAB color to a given (possibly out-of-gamut) LAB color.
    
    **The Strategy:** When a color is out of gamut, it's usually because it's
    too *saturated* (high chroma). So we convert to LCH, then use binary search
    to find the maximum chroma that still fits in sRGB. This preserves:
    - ✅ Lightness (L) - stays the same
    - ✅ Hue (h) - stays the same  
    - ❌ Chroma (C) - reduced until it fits
    
    **Why this works:** Think of it like turning down the "saturation" slider
    in Photoshop until the color becomes displayable. The hue doesn't change
    (red stays red), it just becomes less "punchy."
    
    **Binary search magic:** Instead of trying every possible chroma value
    (0.0, 0.01, 0.02, ...), we do a binary search. Each iteration cuts the
    search space in half. After 20 iterations, we've checked 2^20 = 1 million
    possible values! 🚀
    
    Args:
        lab: Potentially out-of-gamut L*a*b* color
        max_iterations: Maximum desaturation steps (binary search iterations).
                       If None, uses global config value (default 20).
    
    Returns:
        In-gamut L*a*b* color (closest match that can be displayed)
    
    Example:
        >>> # Super saturated red - can't be displayed!
        >>> out_of_gamut = (50, 100, 80)
        >>> displayable = find_nearest_in_gamut(out_of_gamut)
        >>> # Result: same lightness and hue, but less saturated
        >>> is_in_srgb_gamut(displayable)

    """
    Convert LAB to RGB and back to LAB (with clamping).
    
    This is the "quick and dirty" approach to gamut mapping. Instead of
    carefully desaturating, we just let lab_to_rgb() clamp the RGB values
    to 0-255, then convert back to LAB to see what we got.
    
    **Pros:** Fast!
    
    **Cons:** Can change hue (not just chroma). A pure red might become
    a slightly orange-red after clamping.
    
    For most applications, `find_nearest_in_gamut()` is better because it
    preserves hue. This function exists for when you need speed over accuracy.
