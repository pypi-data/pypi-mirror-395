         Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
         Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
         of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
        
        
          This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
        the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
        License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.
        
          0. Additional Definitions.
        
          As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
        General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU
        General Public License.
        
          "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,
        other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.
        
          An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided
        by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
        Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
        of using an interface provided by the Library.
        
          A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an
        Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
        with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked
        Version".
        
          The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
        Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
        for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
        based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.
        
          The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the
        object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
        and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
        Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.
        
          1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.
        
          You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
        without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.
        
          2. Conveying Modified Versions.
        
          If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
        facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
        that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
        facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
        version:
        
           a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
           ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
           function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
           whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or
        
           b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
           this License applicable to that copy.
        
          3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.
        
          The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
        a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
        code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
        material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
        layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
        (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:
        
           a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
           Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
           covered by this License.
        
           b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
           document.
        
          4. Combined Works.
        
          You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
        taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
        portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
        engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
        the following:
        
           a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
           the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
           covered by this License.
        
           b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
           document.
        
           c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
           execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
           these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
           copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.
        
           d) Do one of the following:
        
               0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
               License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
               suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
               recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
               the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
               manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
               Corresponding Source.
        
               1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
               Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
               a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
               system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
               of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
               Version.
        
           e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
           be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
           GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
           necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
           Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
           Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
           you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
           the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
           Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
           Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
           for conveying Corresponding Source.)
        
          5. Combined Libraries.
        
          You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
        Library side by side in a single library together with other library
        facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
        License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
        choice, if you do both of the following:
        
           a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
           on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
           conveyed under the terms of this License.
        
           b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
           is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
           accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
        
          6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.
        
          The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
        of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
        versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
        differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
        
          Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
        Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
        of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"
        applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
        conditions either of that published version or of any later version
        published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
        received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
        General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
        General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
        
          If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
        whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
        apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
        permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
        Library.

odoo-configurator
=================

Odoo Configurator simplifies and automates the configuration of Odoo using YAML files. 
It allows you to update the database, install/update/uninstall modules, configure settings, 
manage users, and perform various data manipulation operations. 
It is an essential tool for Odoo administrators looking to streamline their configuration workflow.

## Installation

    pip install odoo-configurator

## Usage

    odoo-configurator ./work_dir/project_name.local.yml

To run a configuration from the source code:

    /odoo-configurator/start_config.py ./work_dir/project_name.local.yml

Provided file must contain the auth/odoo section to set connexion parameters.

#### project_name.local.yml

```yml
    name: project_name local
    version: 16.0

    inherits:
        - ../work_dir/project_name/project_name.yml

    auth:
        odoo:
            url: http://project_name.localhost
            dbname: project_name
            username: admin
            password: admin123
```

The`version` parameter is required for odoo versions >= 15.0

It's also possible to provide auth for other odoo servers, these connections can be used in python script files and specific imports.
```yml
    auth:
      odoo:
        url: http://project_name.localhost
        dbname: project_name
        username: admin
        password: admin
        version: 16.0
      odoo_base_v8:
        url: http://old.odoo.localhost
        dbname: project_name_v8
        username: admin
        password: admin
        version: 8.0
      odoo_base_v17:
        url: http://next.odoo.localhost
        dbname: project_name_v17
        username: admin
        password: admin
        version: 17.0
```
### Extra parameters
When running odoo-configurator, you can provide the following optional arguments:
- --lang: Set the language for the Odoo connection (default value: 'fr_FR')

## Inherits

Inherits param provide a list of configuration files witch content is merged before execution.

```yml
    inherits:
        - ../work_dir/project_name/sales.yml
        - ../work_dir/project_name/account.yml
 ```

## Script Files

Script Files param provide a list of configuration files witch content will be executed sequentially.

```yml
    script_files:
        - ../work_dir/project_name/script1.yml
        - ../work_dir/project_name/script2.yml
```

## Parameters

**Install Mode**: To import datas with the value **on_install_only: True** add the "--install" parameter in command
line:

    ./start_config.py ./clients/name/name.local.yml --install

## Environment variables

Some parameters can be provided by environment variable.

Use ODOO_URL, ODOO_DB, ODOO_USER and ODOO_PASSWORD instead of using auth/odoo params in config file

Use KEEPASS_PASSWORD instead of --keepass command line parameter

## Pre Update

To prepare a configuration or add a fix use "pre_update" from a top-level configuration, the given scripts will be executed before the normal configuration.

```yml
    pre_update:
        - ../exemple/exemple.pre_update_script.yml
```

## Modules

To install modules use "modules"
```yml
    base:
      modules:
        - example_module
```

To update modules use "updates"
```yml
    base:
      updates:
        - example_module
```

To uninstall modules use "uninstall_modules"
```yml
    base:
      uninstall_modules:
        - example_module
```

## Set config parameters (Settings)

to set the value of a setting (res.config.settings)
```yml
    settings:
      config:
        group_use_lead: True
```

For a specific company configuration use the `company_id` parameter:
```yml
    settings main_company:
      config:
        company_id: get_ref("base.main_company")
        chart_template_id: get_ref("l10n_fr.l10n_fr_pcg_chart_template")
        context: { 'lang': 'fr_FR' }
```

A context can be passed to the config command.

## Set system parameters

to set the value of a system parameter (ir.config_parameter)
```yml
Company System Parameters:
  system_parameter:
    Mail Default From Filter:
      key: mail.default.from_filter
      value: my-company.com
  ```


## Create or update records
    
If the record with the xml id provided with force_id don't exist, the record will be created.    

```yml
    Records to create:
        datas:
            My record 1:
                model: res.partner
                force_id: external_config.partner_1
                values:
                    name: Partner 1
                    ref: PARTNER1
            My record 2:
                model: res.user
                force_id: base.user_admin
                values:
                    name: Admin User
```

## Load records

Using load parameter will speed up creation and update of record compared to single record update.

```yml
    Records to load:
        load: True
        model: res.partner
        datas:
            My record 1:
                force_id: external_config.record1
                values:
                    name: Record 1
                    ref: REC1
            My record 2:
                force_id: external_config.record2
                values:
                    name: Record 2
                    ref: REC2
```

## Update records with a domain

To update values of multiple records, set a domain with "update_domain" :
```yml
    Update Example:
      model: res.partner
      update_domain: "[('email','=','example@test.com')]"
      values:
        name: Example
```

## Available functions

All functions in OdooConnection starting by `get_` are callable from yml files.
 - get_ref
 - get_image_url
 - get_image_local
 - get_local_file
 - get_country
 - get_menu
 - get_search_id
 - get_xml_id_from_id
 - get_record

These functions can be nested by using the o object:

```yml
Ir model Data Config:
  datas:
    Add employee document xmlid:
      model: ir.model.data
      force_id: template_01_employee_01
      values:
        model: paper.paper
        module: external_config
        name: template_01_employee_01
        res_id: get_search_id('paper.paper', [
                ('template_id', '=', o.get_ref('external_config.template_01')),
                ('res_id', '=', o.get_ref('external_config.employee_01'))
                ], 'desc')
```

## Special field name

field_name_id/id : to provide a xmlid to many2one fields instead of a value, without using get_ref.
field_name_ids/id : to provide a list of xmlid to many2many fields.
field_name_ids.ids : to provide a string that will be evaluated to compute the raw values for a many2many field.
field_name/json : to provide a list or dict to convert into json string.

```yml
    res_partner:
        datas:
            My record 1:
                model: res.partner
                force_id: external_config.partner_1
                values:
                    name: Partner 1
                    ref: PARTNER1
                    field_name_id/id: external_config.partner_1
                    field_name_ids/id: [external_config.partner_2, external_config.partner_3]
                    field_name2_ids/id:
                        - external_config.partner_2
                        - external_config.partner_3
                    field_name3_ids.ids: "[[6, 0, [o.get_ref('external_config.partner_2')]]]"
                    field_name/json: {"key1": "value1", "key2": "value2"}
```

## Server Actions and Functions

To call a model function:
```yml
    001 Call Function:
      datas:
        Call Function:
          function: example_function
          model: res.parnter
          res_id: get_ref("base.partner_demo")
          params: ['param1', param2]
          kw: {'extra_param1': get_ref('external_config.extra_param1')}  
```

To call an action server (`ir.actions.server`):

        ```

## Translations

To set the translation of a translatable field, use the **languages** option.
Example:
```yml
    Mail Templates:
        datas:
            Notification:
                model: mail.template
                force_id: mail.notification_template

    slack_token: xxxxx
```

The Slack token can also be set by passing it as an argument with the `--slack-token` option.

To send notifications from a python script:
```python
from odoo_configurator.import_manager import ImportManager
def import_stuff(self, params=dict):
    self.set_params(params)
    self.configurator.slack.send_message('Starting Stuff Import')
```

Note: To use Slack notification, the `Odoo Configurator` Slack app must be added in the channel.

## Keepass

Keepass is a tool to store and protect passwords.

Available functions to use stored values in Keepass:
```yml
    password: get_keepass_password('path/passwords.kdbx', 'Folder Name', 'Key Name')
    user: get_keepass_user('path/passwords.kdbx', 'Folder Name', 'Key Name')
    url: get_keepass_url('path/passwords.kdbx', 'Folder Name', 'Key Name')
```

To avoid to repeat path and group in Keepass functions, you can set `keepass_path` and `keepass_group`
```yml
keepass_path: path/passwords.kdbx
keepass_group: Folder Name

my_secret: get_keepass_password('Key Name')
```

3 ways to pass the Keepass password to odoo-configurator :
 - Provide Keepass password with the keepass parameter in command line: `--keepass='mdp***'`
 - Set the `KEEPASS_PASSWORD` environment variable
 - Manually. If it's required odoo-configurator will ask to type the password with the prompt `Keepass Password:`

 In PyCharm, to type the Keepass password, please check the `Emulate terminal in output console` option in your run/debug configuration.

## Bitwarden

Bitwarden is a tool to store and protect passwords. Make sure Bitwarden CLI is installed.

Credentials to connect to Bitwarden Vault can be set by environment variables, please report to the [s6r-bitwarden-cli documentation](https://pypi.org/project/s6r-bitwarden-cli)

An over option is to set the value of `bitwarden_username` and  `bitwarden_password` in yml file. Obviously, do not save password directly in your yml file, use Keepass functions for example.

```yml
bitwarden_username: get_keepass_user('Bitwarden')
bitwarden_password: get_keepass_password('Bitwarden')
```

## Standard CSV Import

Columns in the CSV file must be the technical name of the field.
A column "id" is required to allow update of datas. 

In yml file, use the **import_csv** entry in the **import_data** section:

```yml
    import_data:
        import_csv Product Template:
            on_install_only: True
            model: product.template
            name_create_enabled_fields: uom_id,uom_po_id,subscription_template_id
            file_path: ../datas/todoo/product.template.csv
            specific_import: base/import_specific.py
            specific_method: import_partner
            batch_size: 200
            skip_line: 1420
            limit: 100
            context: {'install_mode': True}
```

### Required fields:

  - model
  - file_path

### Optional fields:

  - **name_create_enabled_fields** : List of the fields which are allowed to "Create the record if it doesn't exist"
  - **on_install_only** : Do the csv export only in **Install Mode**
  - **context** : Provide a specific context for imports
  - **specific_import** : Path to a specific Python file
  - **specific_method** : Import method to use form the file **specific_import**
  - **batch_size** : Number of records by load batch
  - **limit** : Maximum number of record to import
  - **skip_line** : index of the record to start with

## Specific Import with Python script

Use the **import_data** section:

```yml
Import Scripts:
  import_data:
    Task Import 001:
      model: project.product
      file_path: scripts/products.csv
      specific_import: scripts/import_products.py
      specific_method: import_products
```

scripts/import_products.py :

```python
from odoo_configurator.import_manager import ImportManager

def import_products(self, file_path, model, params):
    self.set_params(params)
    fields = self.get_model_fields(model)
    raw_datas = self.parse_csv_file_dictreader(file_path, fields)
    m_order = self.odoo.model('sale.order')
    orders = m_order.search([], context=self._context)
    self.logger.info('Orders : %s' % ','.join([o['name'] for o in orders]))
    company_ids_cache = self.odoo.get_id_ref_dict('res.company')
    company_xmlid_cache = self.odoo.get_xmlid_dict('res.company')
    products = self.odoo.search('product.template', [], context=self._context)
    ...

ImportManager.import_products = import_products
```


## Run Python script

Use the **python_script** section:

```yml
python_script:
  Data Transfer:
    file: scripts/transfer_script.py
    method: data_transfer
    params:
      param1: TEST
```

It's possible to add connection to other odoo database by adding, for exemple, _odoo_base_v16_ in the **auth** section.
_odoo_base_v16_ can be used easily in python scripts by referring to self.odoo_base_v16:

```yml
auth:
  odoo:
    url: http://odoo_my_customer17.localhost
    dbname: my_customer17
    username: admin
    password: admin
    version: 17.0
  odoo_base_v16:
    url: http://odoo_my_customer16.localhost
    dbname: my_customer16
    username: admin
    password: admin
    version: 16.0
```

scripts/transfer_script.py :

```python
from src.odoo_configurator.import_manager import ImportManager

def data_transfer(self, params=dict):
    # Search analytic lines on my_customer17 (the main database)
    analytic_lines = self.odoo.search("account.analytic.line", [], fields=['name', 'partner_id'])
    for analytic_line in analytic_lines:
        if analytic_line['partner_id']:
            partner_id = analytic_line['partner_id'][0]
            # Read partner on my_customer16 (the extra database)
            partner = self.odoo_base_v16.read('res.partner', [partner_id], fields=['name', 'email'])
            if partner:
                self.logger.info('analytic_line %s partner %s' % (analytic_line['id'], partner[0]['name']))

ImportManager.data_transfer = data_transfer
```

## Connection to SQL database

Use the **sql_auth** section:

```yml
sql_auth:
  sql_my_shop:
    db_type: postgresql
    url: localhost
    dbname: my_shop_prod
    username: admin
    password: get_keepass_password('My Shop Admin')
```

### Available database types
 * Postgresql (postgresql)
 * MS SQL Server (mssql)
 * MySQL (mysql)

scripts/sql_transfer_script.py :

```python
from src.odoo_configurator.import_manager import ImportManager

def sql_transfer(self, params=dict):
    query = 'select name, email from res_partner'
    cr = self.sql_my_shop.execute(query)
    for partner_values in cr.fetchall():
            self.logger.info('Partner %s' % partner_values['name'])

ImportManager.sql_transfer = sql_transfer
```


## Generate YML data file from a Odoo database

'import_configurator_model_file' configuration will generate a res_partner.yml file in the **config** directory
```yml
Actions:
    import_configurator_model_file:
        Portal Form:
            model: res.partner
            domain: [['is_company', '=', True]]  # Don't use parenthesis in the domain
            order_by: name, ref
            force_export_fields: ["email_formatted", "country_code"]
            excluded_fields: ["email", "country_id"]
            context: {'active_test': False}
```

'import_configurator_module' configuration will generate a 'studio_customization' directory in the **config** directory, with a file for each model containing the records of the module.
```yml
 Actions:           
    import_configurator_module:
        module: 'studio_customization'
```

## Release Configuration

Some configurations need to be executed on every platform until the production release. After that we need to archive these configuration files.
We will store the files in the directory *release_config* for example.
To run all these files, add the **release_directory** parameter in your main configuration file:

```yml
    release_directory: ./release_config
```

To back up the release files after the execution of the production configuration, add the **clear_release_directory** parameter in you production configuration file.

```yml
  clear_release_directory: True
```
