##  Development

This project uses uv for dependency management. Make sure you have uv installed:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

## Run development

This will install development dependencies:

```bash
make devel
```

## Publish a New Version

To create a new version, follow these steps:

1. Make sure all your changes are committed.

2. Run one of the following commands to bump the version in pyproject.toml:

For a major version bump (e.g., 1.0.0 -> 2.0.0)
```bash
make bump-version TYPE=major
```

For a minor version bump (e.g., 1.0.0 -> 1.1.0)
```bash
make bump-version TYPE=minor
```

For a patch version bump (e.g., 1.0.0 -> 1.0.1)
```bash
make bump-version TYPE=patch
```

**Commit the changes to the repository.*

3. Create a git tag with the new version:
```bash
make create-tag
```

4. Push the changes and new tag to trigger the CI/CD pipeline:
```bash
git push origin
git push origin --tags
```

The CI/CD pipeline will automatically build and deploy the new version when it detects the new tag.
