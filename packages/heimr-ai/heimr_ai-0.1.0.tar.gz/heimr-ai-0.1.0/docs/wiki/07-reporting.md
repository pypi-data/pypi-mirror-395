# Reporting

[← Back to Index](../WIKI.md)

Heimr automatically generates rich, multi-format reports for every analysis run. These reports are designed to serve different stakeholders: SREs needing deep technical data, Managers needing high-level summaries, and Automated Systems needing structured data.

## 1. The Core Artifact: Markdown Report (`.md`)

This is the primary output file specified by the `--output` flag (default: `report.md`). It is a self-contained document perfect for rendering in GitHub/GitLab, Wikis, or Notion.

### Structure
1.  **Executive Summary**: A high-level verdict (Pass/Fail) and a bulleted list of critical findings generated by the AI.
2.  **Context Header**: (Optional) Tags for Commit SHA, Branch, Environment context.
3.  **KPI Table**: Transposed table showing metrics (P95, P99, Error Rate, RPS) per endpoint.
4.  **AI Root Cause Analysis**: A detailed narrative explaining *why* performance degraded, correlating load test spikes with system metrics (CPU, Memory, Logs).
5.  **Technical Deep Dive**: Raw charts, histograms, and top error logs.

## 2. PDF Report

For formal reporting or archiving, a PDF version (e.g., `report.pdf`) is generated. It mirrors the Markdown content but is styled for print/sharing with leadership.

## 3. CI/CD Summaries

When running in CI/CD, Heimr outputs specialized formats to integrate directly with build tools.

*   **GitHub Step Summary**: A condensed markdown snippet written to `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`. It provides a "Traffic Light" view (✅/❌) directly in the Actions UI.
*   **JUnit XML**: A standard test results file (e.g., `results.xml`) compatible with Jenkins, GitLab CI, and other test runners. It treats performance thresholds as individual test cases.

## Configuration

You generally control reporting via the `analyze` command options:

*   `--output`: Sets the base name/path for artifacts.
*   `--no-llm`: Skips the AI sections (Result is a "Stats Only" report).
*   `--ci-summary`: Explicitly triggers the GitHub summary generation.
*   `--junit-output`: Explicitly triggers the XML generation.
