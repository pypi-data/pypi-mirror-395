# 🪐 Imaging Server Kit

Turn Python-based image processing workflows into **algorithms** that gain extra functionalities.

- [**Turn your algorithms into web servers**](https://imaging-server-kit.github.io/imaging-server-kit/sections/07_server.html) and run computations from [QuPath](https://github.com/Imaging-Server-Kit/qupath-extension-serverkit), [Napari](https://github.com/Imaging-Server-Kit/napari-serverkit), or [Python](./sections/08_python) via HTTP requests.

- [**Generate dock widgets**](https://imaging-server-kit.github.io/imaging-server-kit/sections/01_algorithm.html) to run your algorithms interactively in Napari.

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ff572f7-f159-4f5a-afd4-7a157de3d9f8

- Run your algorithms [**tile-by-tile**](https://imaging-server-kit.github.io/imaging-server-kit/sections/06_tiled.html) on the input data.

- [**Stream results**](https://imaging-server-kit.github.io/imaging-server-kit/sections/05_streams.html) to inspect them in real-time.
