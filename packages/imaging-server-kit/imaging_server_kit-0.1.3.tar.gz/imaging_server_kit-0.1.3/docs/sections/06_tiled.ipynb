    "# Tiled inference\n",
    "\n",
    "Tiled inference consists in **running an algorithm tile-by-tile** on individual subpatches (tiles) instead of the whole image at once. The results from each tiles are assembled to form the final result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tiled inference can be useful in these contexts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The algorithm is **embarrassingly parallel** (Note: this is not the case for instance segmentation, for example).\n",
    "- Users need to see the results appear progressively (if needed, they can cancel the process before it finishes).\n",
    "- To apply a deep learning model with a fixed context window (input size) on images of varying sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "All Server Kit algorithms are tileable. You can control the **tile size** (in pixels), **overlap** (fraction), processing **order** of the tiles (random or not), and the time delay introduced between processing of consecutive tiles. \n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "Tiled inference is an **experimental feature**. We aren't fully done implementing and testing it yet. Expect some improvements in the near future!\n",
