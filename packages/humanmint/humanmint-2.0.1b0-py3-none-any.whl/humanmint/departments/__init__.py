"""
Department processing utilities for HumanMint.

Provides normalization, fuzzy matching, and categorization of department names
with a comprehensive canonical list of standardized departments.

Example:
    >>> from humanmint.departments import normalize_department, find_best_match
    >>> raw_dept = "Public Works 850-123-1234 ext 200"
    >>> normalized = normalize_department(raw_dept)
    >>> normalized
    "Public Works"
    >>> matched = find_best_match("PW Dept")
    >>> matched
    "Public Works"
