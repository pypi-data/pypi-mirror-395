              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise

              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/sqlalchemy-declarative-extensions/badge/?version=latest)](https://sqlalchemy-declarative-extensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

See the full documentation
[here](https://sqlalchemy-declarative-extensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Adds extensions to SQLAlchemy (and/or Alembic) which allows declaratively
stating the existence of additional kinds of objects about your database not
natively supported by SQLAlchemy/Alembic.

The primary function(s) of this library include:

- Registering onto the SQLAlchemy event system such that `metadata.create_all`
  creates these objects.
- (Optionally) Registers into Alembic such that
  `alembic revision --autogenerate` automatically creates/updates/deletes
  declared objects.

Object support includes:

|                | Postgres | MySQL | SQLite | Snowflake |
| -------------- | -------- | ----- | ------ | --------- |
| Schemas        | ✓        | N/A   | ✓      | ✓         |
| Views          | ✓        | ✓     | ✓      | ✓         |
| Roles          | ✓        |       | N/A    | ✓         |
| Grants         | ✓        |       | N/A    |           |
| Default Grants | ✓        |       | N/A    |           |
| Functions      | ✓        | ✓     |        |           |
| Procedures     | ✓        | ✓     |        |           |
| Triggers       | ✓        | ✓     |        |           |
| Databases      | ✓        |       | N/A    | ✓         |
| Rows (data)    | ✓        | ✓     | ✓      | ✓         |
| "Audit Tables" | ✓        |       |        |           |

Notes:

- "Row" is implemented with pure SQLAlchemy concepts, so should work for any
  dialect that you can use SQLAlchemy to connect to.
- "Audit Tables" are a higher-level set of functions/triggers which record data
  changes against some source table.

In principle, this library **can** absolutely support any database supported by
SQLAlchemy, and capable of being introspected enough to support detection of
different kinds of objects. In reality, the existence of implementations are going to
be purely driven by actual usage/contributions/requests.

See [docs on dialect support](https://sqlalchemy-declarative-extensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing/dialect-support.html)
for information on how to improve support for a given dialect. Also feel free to submit an issue!

## Kitchen Sink Example (using all available features)

```python
from sqlalchemy import Column, types, select
from sqlalchemy.orm import as_declarative
from sqlalchemy_declarative_extensions import (
    declarative_database, Schemas, Roles, Row, View, view,
)
from sqlalchemy_declarative_extensions.dialects.postgresql import (
    DefaultGrant, Function, Trigger, Role
)
from sqlalchemy_declarative_extensions.audit import audit


@declarative_database
@as_declarative
class Base:
    # Note: each object type also has a plural version (i.e. Schemas/Roles/etc) where you can specify
    # collection-level options like `ignore_unspecified`).
    #
    # If you dont set any collection-level options, you can instead use raw list/iterable as the collection.
    schemas = Schemas().are("example")
    roles = Roles(ignore_unspecified=True).are(
        Role("read", login=False),
        Role(
            "app",
            in_roles=['read']
        ),
    )
    grants = [
        DefaultGrant.on_tables_in_schema("public", 'example').grant("select", to="read"),
        DefaultGrant.on_sequences_in_schema("public").grant("usage", to="read"),
        Grant.new("usage", to="read").on_schemas("example")
    ]
    rows = [
        Row('foo', id=1),
    ]
    views = [
        View("low_foo", "select * from foo where i < 10"),
    ]
    functions = [
        Function(
            "fancy_function",
            """
            BEGIN
            INSERT INTO foo (id) select NEW.id + 1;
            RETURN NULL;
            END
            """,
            language="plpgsql",
            returns="trigger",
        ),
    ]
    triggers = [
        Trigger.after("insert", on="foo", execute="fancy_function")
        .named("on_insert_foo")
        .when("pg_trigger_depth() < 1")
        .for_each_row(),
    ]


@audit()
class Foo(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'foo'

    id = Column(types.Integer(), primary_key=True)


audit_table = Foo.__audit_table__


@view(Base)
class HighFoo:
    __tablename__ = "high_foo"
    __view__ = select(Foo.__table__).where(Foo.__table__.c.id >= 10)
```

Note, there is also support for declaring objects directly through the
`MetaData` for users not using sqlalchemy's declarative API.

## Event Registration

By default, the above example does not automatically do anything. Depending on
the context, you can use one of two registration hooks:
`register_sqlalchemy_events` or `register_alembic_events`.

### `register_sqlalchemy_events`

This registers events in SQLAlchemy's event system such that a
`metadata.create_all(...)` call will create the declared database objects.

```python
from sqlalchemy_declarative_extensions import register_sqlalchemy_events

metadata = Base.metadata  # Given the example above.
register_sqlalchemy_events(metadata)
# Which is equivalent to...
register_sqlalchemy_events(metadata, schemas=False, roles=False, grants=False, rows=False)
```

All object types are opt in, and should be explicitly included in order to get
registered.

Practically, this is to avoid issues with testing. In **most** cases the
`metadata.create_all` call will be run in tests, a context where it's more
likely that you dont **need** grants or grants, and where parallel test
execution could lead to issues with role or schema creation, depending on your
setup.

### `register_alembic_events`

This registers comparators in Alembic's registration system such that an
`alembic revision --autogenerate` command will diff the existing database state
against the declared database objects, and issue statements to
create/update/delete objects in order to match the declared state.

```python
# alembic's `env.py`
from sqlalchemy_declarative_extensions import register_alembic_events

register_alembic_events()
# Which is equivalent to...
register_sqlalchemy_events(schemas=True, roles=True, grants=True, rows=True)
```

All object types are opt out but can be excluded.

In contrast to `register_sqlalchemy_events`, it's much more likely that you're
declaring most of these object types in order to have alembic track them

## Alembic-utils

[Alembic Utils](https://github.com/olirice/alembic_utils) is the primary library
against which this library can be compared. At time of writing, **most** (but
not all) object types supported by alembic-utils are supported by this library.
One might begin to question when to use which library.

Below is a list of points on which the two libraries diverge. But note that you
**can** certainly use both in tandem! It doesn't need to be one or the other,
and certainly for any object types which do not overlap, you might **need** to
use both.

- Database Support

  - Alembic Utils seems to explicitly only support PostgreSQL.

  - This library is designed to support any dialect (in theory). Certainly
    PostgreSQL is **best** supported, but there does exist support for specific
    kinds of objects to varying levels of support for Snowflake, SQLite, and MySQL,
    so far.

- Architecture

  - Alembic Utils is directly tied to Alembic and does not support SQLAlchemy's
    `MetaData.create_all`. It's also the responsibility of the user to
    discover/register objects in alembic.

  - This library **depends** only on SQLAlchemy, although it also supports
    alembic. Support for `MetaData.create_all` can be important for creating all
    object types in tests. It also is designed such that objects are registered
    on the `MetaData` itself, so there is no need for any specific discovery
    phase.

- Scope

  - Alembic Utils declares specific, individual objects. I.e. you instantiate
    one specific `PGGrantTable` or `PGView` instance and Alembic know knows you
    want that object to be created. It cannot drop objects it is not already
    aware of.

  - This library declares the objects the system as a whole expects to exist.
    Similar to Alembic's behavior on tables, it will (by default) detect any
    **undeclared** objects that should not exist and drop them. That means, you
    can rely on this object to ensure the state of your migrations matches the
    state of your database exactly.

- Migration history

  - Alembic Utils imports and references its own objects in your migrations
    history. This can be unfortunate, in that it deeply ties your migrations
    history to alembic-utils.

    (In fact, this can be a sticking point, trying to convert **away** from
    `alembic_utils`, because it will attempt to drop all the (e.g `PGView`)
    instances previously created when we replaced it with this library.)

  - This library, by contrast, prefers to emit the raw SQL of the operation into
    your migration. That means you know the exact commands that will execute in
    your migration, which can be helpful in debugging failure. It also means, if
    at any point you decide to stop use of the library (or pause a given type of
    object, due to a bug), you can! This library's behaviors are primarily very
    much `--autogenerate`-time only.

- Abstraction Level

  - Alembic Utils appears to define a very "literal" interface (for example,
    `PGView` accepts the whole view definition as a raw literal string).

  - This library tries to, as much as possible, provide a more abstracted
    interface that enables more compatibility with SQLAlchemy (For example
    `View` accepts SQLAlchemy objects which can be coerced into a `SELECT`). It
    also tends towards "builder" interfaces which progressively produce a object
    (Take a look at the `DefaultGrant` above, for an example of where that's
    helpful).

A separate note on conversion/compatibility. Where possible, this library tries
to support alembic-utils native objects as stand-ins for the objects defined in
this library. For example, `alembic_utils.pg_view.PGView` can be declared
instead of a `sqlalchemy_declarative_extensions.View`, and we will internally
coerce it into the appropriate type. Hopefully this eases any transitional
costs, or issues using one or the other library.
