# AMR annotation and feature generation

Provides support for AMR graph manipulation, annotations and feature
generation.

Features:
* Annotation in AMR metadata.  For example, sentence types found in the Proxy
  report AMR corpus.
* AMR token alignment as [spaCy] components.
* Integrates natural language parsing and features with Zensols
  [zensols.nlparse] library.
* A scoring API that includes [Smatch] and [WLK], which extends a more general
  [NLP scoring module].
* AMR parsing ([amrlib]) and AMR co-reference ([amr_coref]).
* Command line and API utilities for AMR graph Penman graphs, debugging and
  files.
* Tools for [training and evaluating](#training) new AMR parse (text to graph)
  and generation (graph to text) models.
* A method for re-indexing and updating AMR graph variables so that all in a
  document collection are unique.


## Documentation

* [Full documentation](https://plandes.github.io/amr/index.html).
* [API reference](https://plandes.github.io/amr/api.html)


## Installing

The library can be installed with pip from the [pypi] repository:
```bash
pip3 install zensols.amr
```

### Installing the Gsii Model

The Gsii model link expires and requires a manual download of the model.  To
install it, do the following:

1. Download the [Gsii model] (click "direct download").
1. Move the file to the local directory.
1. Install the file by forcing a test parse:
   ```bash
   amr parse 'Test sentence.' --override \
       amr_parse_gsii_resource.url=file:model_parse_gsii-v0_1_0.tar.gz
   ```

## Usage

```python
from typing import List
from pathlib import Path
from penman.graph import Graph
from zensols.nlp import FeatureDocument, FeatureDocumentParser
from zensols.amr import AmrDocument, AmrSentence, Dumper, ApplicationFactory
import pandas

sent: str = """

He was George Washington and first president of the United States.
He was born On February 22, 1732.

""".replace('\n', ' ').strip()

# get the AMR document parser
doc_parser: FeatureDocumentParser = ApplicationFactory.get_doc_parser()

# the parser creates a NLP centric feature document as provided in the
# zensols.nlp package
doc: FeatureDocument = doc_parser(sent)

# the AMR object graph data structure is provided in the feature document
amr_doc: AmrDocument = doc.amr

# dump a human readable output of the AMR document
amr_doc.write()

# get the first AMR sentence instance
amr_sent: AmrSentence = amr_doc.sents[0]
print('sentence:')
print(' ', amr_sent.text)
print('tuples:')

# show the Penman graph representation
pgraph: Graph = amr_sent.graph
print(f'variables: {", ".join(pgraph.variables())}')
for t in pgraph.triples:
    print(' ', t)
print('edges:')
for e in pgraph.edges():
    print(' ', e)

# visualize the graph as a PDF
dumper: Dumper = ApplicationFactory.get_dumper()
List[Path] = dumper(amr_doc)
```

The [default.conf](resources/default.conf) sets the default AMR parser, which
is overridden by the `amr_default:parse_mode` property.  You can select the
large BART AMR parser with `--override=amr_default:parse_mode=xfm_bart_large`
on the command line.


### Library

When adding the `amr` spaCy pipeline component, the `doc._.amr` attribute is
set on the `Doc` instance.  You can either configure spaCy yourself, or you can
use the configuration files in [test-resources](test-resources) as an example
using the [zensols.util configuration framework].  The command line application
provides an example how to do this, along with the [test
case](test/python/test_amr.py).


### Command Line

This library is written mostly to be used by other program, but the command
line utility `amr` is also available to demonstrate its usage and to generate
ARM graphs on the command line.

To parse:
```bash
$ amr parse -c test-resources/t5.conf 'This is a test of the AMR command line utility.'
```
output:
```clojure
# ::snt This is a test of the AMR command line utility.
(t / test-01
   :ARG1 (u / utility
            :mod (c / command-line)
            :name (n / name
                     :op1 "AMR"
                     :toki1 "6")
            :toki1 "9")
   :domain (t2 / this
               :toki1 "0")
   :toki1 "3")
```

To generate graphs in PDF format:
```bash
$ amr plot -c test-resources/t5.conf 'This is a test of the AMR command line utility.'
wrote: amr-graph/this-is-a-test-of-the-amr-comm.pdf
```


## Training

This package uses the [amrlib] training, but adds a command line and
downloadable corpus aggregation / API.  To train:

1. Choose a model (i.e. SPRING, T5).
1. Optionally edit the [train configuration](train-config) directory of the
   model you choose.
1. Optionally edit the `resources/train.yml` to select/add more corpora (see
   [Adding Corpora](adding-corpora)).
1. Train the model: `./amr --config train-config/<model>.conf`


### Pretrained Models

This library was used to train all of the [amrlib] models (using the same
checkpoints as [amrlib]), except the T5 Base v1 model, with additional
examples from publicly available human annotated corpora.  The differences of
these trained models include:

* None of the models were tested against a training set, only the development
  SMATCH scores are available.  This was intentional to provide more training
  examples.
* The AMR Release 3.0 ([LDC2020T02]) test set was added to the training set.
* The [Little Prince and Bio AMR](https://amr.isi.edu/download.html) corpora
  where used to train the models.  The first 85% of the AMR sentences were
  added to training set and the remaining 15% were added to the development
  set.
* The mini-batch size changed for `generate-t5wtense-base` due to memory
  constraints.
* The number of training epochs were increased to account for the additional
  number of training examples.
* Models have the same naming conventions but are prefixed with `zsl`.
* Generative models were trained on graphs metadata annotated by the Sci spaCy
  `en_core_sci_md` model.

The performance of these models:

| Model Name           | Model Type | Checkpoint             | Performance   |
|----------------------|------------|------------------------|---------------|
| `zsl_spring`         | parse      | [facebook/bart-large]  | SMATCH: 81.26 |
| `zsl_xfm_bart_base`  | parse      | [facebook/bart-base]   | SMATCH: 80.5  |
| `zsl_xfm_bart_large` | parse      | [facebook/bart-large]  | SMATCH: 82.7  |
| `zsl_t5wtense_base`  | generative | [t5-base]              | BLEU: 42.20   |
| `zsl_t5wtense_large` | generative | [google/flan-t5-large] | BLEU: 44.01   |

These models are available upon request.


### Adding Corpora

You can retrain your own model and add additional training corpora by modifying
the list of `${amr_prep_manager:preppers}` in `resources/train.yml`.  This file
defines downloaded corpora for the Little Prince and Bio AMR corpora.  To use
the AMR 3.0 release, add the LDC downloaded file to (a new) `download`
directory.
