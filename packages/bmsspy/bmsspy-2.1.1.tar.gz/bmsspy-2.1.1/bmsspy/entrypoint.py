        Function:

        - Initialize a BMSSP-style shortest path object that can execute a bmssp solve method.
        - Calculates and stores necessary variables for unique path length adjustments.
        - Optionally calculate the constant degree graph and related info.

        Required Arguments:

        - `graph`:
            - Type: list of dictionaries
            - What: The input graph represented as a list of dictionaries where each index represents a node id.
                    Each dictionary contains neighboring node ids as keys and edge weights as values.

        Optional Arguments:

        - `precision`:
            - Type: int
            - Default: 6
            - What: The decimal precision to round edge weights to for calculations
                - Note: This is necessary to ensure that the unique values added to each edge weight do not cause issues with expected returned path lengths.
        - `use_constant_degree_graph`:
            - Type: bool
            - Default: True
            - What: Whether to convert the input graph to a constant degree graph to match the original BMSSP algorithm requirements.
            - Note: It appears that this is not necessary for solving the algorithm, but is used to achieve big O complexity targets.
                    This is default to True even though it appears to be slower in practice for all the graphs we have tested thus far.
