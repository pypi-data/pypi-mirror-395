# ohmly - An electrical and mechanical analysis tool of overhead conductors

Ohmly is a small Python library for performing electrical and mechanical analysis of overhead transmission line conductors.
It models conductor behaviour under different environmental and loading conditions, including tension, sag, ice load, and wind load.

The code includes database-backed conductor properties, catenary equations, state transitions, and utility functions for mechanical design.
The electrical analysis part is yet to come.
