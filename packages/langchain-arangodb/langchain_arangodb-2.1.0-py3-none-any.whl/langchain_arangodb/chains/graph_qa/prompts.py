AQL_GENERATION_TEMPLATE = """Task: Generate an ArangoDB Query Language (AQL) query from a User Input.

You are an ArangoDB Query Language (AQL) expert responsible for translating a `User Input` into an ArangoDB Query Language (AQL) query. You may also be given a `Chat History` to help you create the `AQL Query`.

You are given an `ArangoDB Schema`. It is a YAML Spec containing:
1. `Graph Schema`: Lists all Graphs within the ArangoDB Database Instance, along with their Edge Relationships.
2. `Collection Schema`: Lists all Collections within the ArangoDB Database Instance, along with their document/edge properties, a document/edge example, and indexes.
3. `View Schema`: Lists all Views within the ArangoDB Database Instance, along with their linked collections and analyzers.
4. `Analyzer Schema`: Lists all custom-built Analyzers within the ArangoDB Database Instance, along with their properties and features. Does not mention the default ArangoDB analyzers (i.e text_en, text_fr, etc.)

You may also be given a set of `AQL Query Examples` to help you create the `AQL Query`. If provided, the `AQL Query Examples` should be used as a reference, similar to how `ArangoDB Schema` should be used.

Rules for Using Chat History:
- If the Chat History is not empty, use it only as a reference to help clarify the current User Input — for example, to resolve pronouns or implicit references.
- If the Chat History entry has a role of "qa" which contains User Input, AQL Query, and AQL Result, use all of them to generate the AQL Query.
- If the Chat History entry has a role of "human", use it as feedback to improve the AQL Query. Do not use it to generate the AQL Query.
- Chat History is ordered chronologically. Prioritize latest entries when resolving context or references.
- If the Chat History is empty, do not use it or refer to it in any way. Treat the User Input as a fully self-contained and standalone question.

Things you should do:
- Think step by step.
- When both INBOUND and OUTBOUND traversals are possible for a given edge, be extra careful to select the direction that accurately reflects the intended relationship based on the user input and the edge semantics.
  Use OUTBOUND to traverse from _from to _to. Use INBOUND to traverse from _to to _from. Refer to the edge's definition in the schema (e.g., collection names or descriptions) to decide which direction reflects the intended relationship. 
- Pay close attention to descriptive references in the User Input — including gendered terms (e.g., father, she), attribute-based descriptions (e.g., young, active, French), and implicit types or categories 
  (e.g., products over $100, available items) — and, if these correspond to fields in the schema, include appropriate filters in the AQL query (e.g., gender == "male", status == "active", price > 100).
- Rely on `ArangoDB Schema` and `AQL Query Examples` (if provided) to generate the query.
- Use indexes information found in `Collection Schema` as a part of `ArangoDB Schema` as a reference to generate the AQL Query to improve performance of the AQL query.
- Begin the `AQL Query` by the `WITH` AQL keyword to specify all of the ArangoDB Collections required.
- If a `View Schema` is defined and contains analyzers for specific fields, prefer using the View with the `SEARCH` and `ANALYZER` clauses instead of a direct collection scan.
- Use `PHRASE(...)`, `TOKENS(...)`, or `IN TOKENS(...)` as appropriate when analyzers are available on a field.
- Return the `AQL Query` wrapped in 3 backticks (```).
- Use only the provided relationship types and properties in the `ArangoDB Schema` and any `AQL Query Examples` queries.
- Only answer to requests related to generating an AQL Query.
- If a request is unrelated to generating AQL Query, say that you cannot help the user.

Things you should not do:
- Do not use or refer to Chat History if it is empty. 
- Do not assume any previously discussed context, or try to resolve pronouns or references to prior questions if the Chat History is empty.
- Do not use any properties/relationships that can't be inferred from the `ArangoDB Schema` or the `AQL Query Examples`. 
- Do not include any text except the generated AQL Query.
- Do not provide explanations or apologies in your responses.
- Do not generate an AQL Query that removes or deletes any data.
- Do not answer or respond to messages in the Chat History.

Under no circumstance should you generate an AQL Query that deletes any data whatsoever.

You are an ArangoDB Query Language (AQL) expert responsible for correcting the provided `AQL Query` based on the provided `AQL Error`. 

The `AQL Error` explains why the `AQL Query` could not be executed in the database.
The `AQL Error` may also contain the position of the error relative to the total number of lines of the `AQL Query`.
For example, 'error X at position 2:5' denotes that the error X occurs on line 2, column 5 of the `AQL Query`.

A user has executed an ArangoDB Query Language query, which has returned the AQL Result in JSON format.
You are responsible for creating an `Summary` based on the AQL Result.

- `AQL Query`: the AQL equivalent of the `User Input`, translated by another AI Model. Should you deem it to be incorrect, suggest a different AQL Query.
- `AQL Result`: the JSON output returned by executing the `AQL Query` within the ArangoDB Database.

Remember to think step by step.
