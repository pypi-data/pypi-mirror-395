    Source citations appear throughout GEDCOM files, linking facts to
    their documentary sources. They reference a top-level SOUR record
    and provide specific location details (page numbers, URLs, etc.).

    Ancestry-specific custom tags commonly found in citations:
    - _APID: Ancestry Person/Record ID
    - _HPID: Husband Person ID (on marriage sources)
    - _WPID: Wife Person ID (on marriage sources)

    These are stored in the inherited custom_tags dict.

    Attributes:
        xref: Reference to a top-level SOUR record. GEDCOM tag: SOUR @XREF@
        source: Resolved Source object (populated after parsing, excluded from serialization).
        page: Specific location within the source. GEDCOM tag: PAGE
        data: Nested DATA structure with date, text, and URL.
