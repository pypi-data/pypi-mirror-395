# QOSM - Quasi Optical System Modelling

## Description

QOSM (Quasi Optical System Modelling) is a simulation module developed at IMT Atlantique for modelling quasi-optical 
systems. This project is part of research conducted within the Microwave Department and the Lab-STICC laboratory.

### Main Objective

The QOSM module was designed to simulate and model quasi-optical benches for material characterisation in millimetre 
and sub-millimetre frequency ranges. It enables the analysis of dielectric properties of materials through free-space 
measurements.

## Key Features

### Gaussian Beam Modelling
The system uses Gaussian beam expansion and tracking analysis combined with modal analysis. This approach enables 
modelling of electromagnetic wave propagation in quasi-optical systems.

### S-Parameter Analysis
The module allows comparison of simulated reflection and transmission S-parameters with those measured using a 4-port 
vector network analyser. This functionality is essential for validating theoretical models against experimental 
measurements.

### TRL Calibration
A Thru-Reflect-Line calibration is implemented to de-embed the simulated S-parameters of a dielectric slab located 
between two lens antennas, enabling precise extraction of material properties.

## Project Architecture

The QOSM project is centralised in a single GitLab repository:

- **qosm**: Main project repository (https://gitlab.imt-atlantique.fr/quasi-optical-system-modelling/qosm)

The project groups all quasi-optical modelling functionalities in a unified structure.

### Technologies Used

Based on research, the project likely uses:
- Gaussian beam propagation algorithms
- Modal analysis methods
- Scientific computing tools for electromagnetic simulation

## Scientific Context

### What is Quasi-Optics?

Quasi-optical systems are used in a domain where beam and component dimensions are several multiples of the wavelength. 
For example, at 263 GHz, the wavelength is 1.14 mm, and using a 12.7 mm aperture represents a factor 11 times larger 
than the wavelength.

## Installation and Usage

### Installation via PyPI

QOSM is available as a Python package on PyPI and can be easily installed using pip:

```bash
pip install qosm
```

### Basic Usage

#### Graphical User Interface

Launch the QOSM GUI application:

```bash
python -m qosm
```

#### Python API

```python
import qosm

# Example usage will depend on the specific API
# Please refer to the repository documentation for detailed examples
```

> **Note**: For detailed usage examples and API documentation, please refer to the project repository or contact the 
> development team at IMT Atlantique.

## Associated Publications

Work on QOSM has led to scientific publications, notably in the 
International Journal of Microwave and Wireless Technologies in 2025, 
on "quasi-optical modelling of a millimetre- and submillimetre-wave free-space 
characterisation bench".
