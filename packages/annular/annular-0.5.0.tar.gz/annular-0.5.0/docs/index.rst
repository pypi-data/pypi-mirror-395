Welcome to annular's documentation!
==========================================================

Annular is a framework for running coupled energy system models with the aim of
modeling flexibility scheduling and the policy regulations that affect the
behavior of flexibility providers.

Name
----
**Why the name 'annular'?**

'Annular' means 'in the shape of a ring', with which we specifically think of
the `rings of Saturn`_, containing many moons or in other words satellites, just
like the satellite models interacting with the central market model.

Annular was developed as part of the `DEMOSES`_ project,
funded by NWO under Grant ID: ESI.2019.004.
