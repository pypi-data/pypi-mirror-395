# Installation

## Preparation

We assume you have a working python3.10+ installation. We recommend installing
Annular in a dedicated virtual environment for your project.

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
# source .venv/Scripts/activate  # Use this line instead on Windows
```

## Installing Annular

You can install Annular directly from [PyPI]:

```bash
python3 -m pip install annular
```

To work with the latest unreleased updates, you can also install directly from the repository:

```bash
python3 -m pip install "annular @ git+https://gitlab.tudelft.nl/demoses/annular"
```
