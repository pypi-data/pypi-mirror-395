# JustHTML

A pure Python HTML5 parser that just works. No C extensions to compile. No system dependencies to install. No complex API to learn.

## Why use JustHTML?

### 1. Just... Correct ✅
It implements the official WHATWG HTML5 specification exactly. If a browser can parse it, JustHTML can parse it. It handles all the complex error-handling rules that browsers use.

- **Verified Compliance**: Passes all 8,500+ tests in the official [html5lib-tests](https://github.com/html5lib/html5lib-tests) suite (used by browser vendors).
- **100% Coverage**: Every line and branch of code is covered by integration tests.
- **Fuzz Tested**: Has parsed 3 million randomized broken HTML documents to ensure it never crashes or hangs (see benchmarks/fuzz.py).
- **Living Standard**: It tracks the living standard, not a snapshot from 2012.

### 2. Just... Python 🐍
JustHTML has **zero dependencies**. It's pure Python.

- **Just Install**: No C extensions to compile, no system libraries (like libxml2) required. Works on PyPy, WASM (Pyodide) (yes, it's in the test matrix), and anywhere Python runs.
- **No dependency upgrade hassle**: Some libraries depend on a large set of libraries, all which require upgrades to avoid security issues.
- **Debuggable**: It's just Python code. You can step through it with a debugger to understand exactly how your HTML is being parsed.
- **Returns plain python objects**: Other parsers return lxml or etree trees which means you have another API to learn. JustHTML returns a set of nested objects you can iterate over. Simple.

### 3. Just... Query 🔍
Find elements with CSS selectors. Just one method to learn - `query()` - and it uses CSS syntax you already know.

```python
doc.query("div.container > p.intro")  # Familiar CSS syntax
doc.query("#main, .sidebar")          # Selector groups
doc.query("li:nth-child(2n+1)")       # Pseudo-classes
```

### 4. Just... Fast Enough ⚡

If you need to parse terabytes of data, use a C or Rust parser (like `html5ever`). They are 10x-20x faster.

But for most use cases, JustHTML is **fast enough**. It parses the Wikipedia homepage in ~0.1s. It is the fastest pure-Python HTML5 parser available, outperforming `html5lib` and `BeautifulSoup`.

## Comparison to other parsers

| Parser | HTML5 Compliance | Pure Python? | Speed | Query API | Notes |
|--------|:----------------:|:------------:|-------|-----------|-------|
| **JustHTML** | ✅ **100%** | ✅ Yes | ⚡ Fast | ✅ CSS selectors | It just works. Correct, easy to install, and fast enough. |
| `html5lib` | 🟡 88% | ✅ Yes | 🐢 Slow | ❌ None | The reference implementation. Very correct but quite slow. |
| `html5_parser` | 🟡 84% | ❌ No | 🚀 Very Fast | 🟡 XPath (lxml) | C-based (Gumbo). Fast and mostly correct. |
| `selectolax` | 🟡 68% | ❌ No | 🚀 Very Fast | ✅ CSS selectors | C-based (Lexbor). Very fast but less compliant. |
| `BeautifulSoup` | 🔴 4% | ✅ Yes | 🐢 Slow | 🟡 Custom API | Wrapper around `html.parser`. Not spec compliant. |
| `html.parser` | 🔴 4% | ✅ Yes | ⚡ Fast | ❌ None | Standard library. Chokes on malformed HTML. |
| `lxml` | 🔴 1% | ❌ No | 🚀 Very Fast | 🟡 XPath | C-based (libxml2). Fast but not HTML5 compliant. |

*Compliance scores from running the [html5lib-tests](https://github.com/html5lib/html5lib-tests) suite (1,743 tree-construction tests). See `benchmarks/correctness.py`.*

## Installation

Requires Python 3.10 or later.

```bash
pip install justhtml
```

## Example usage

### Python API

```python
from justhtml import JustHTML

html = "<html><body><div id='main'><p>Hello, <b>world</b>!</p></div></body></html>"
doc = JustHTML(html)

# 1. Traverse the tree
# The tree is made of SimpleDomNode objects.
# Each node has .name, .attrs, .children, and .parent
root = doc.root              # #document
html_node = root.children[0] # html
body = html_node.children[1] # body (children[0] is head)
div = body.children[0]       # div

print(f"Tag: {div.name}")
print(f"Attributes: {div.attrs}")

# 2. Query with CSS selectors
# Find elements using familiar CSS selector syntax
paragraphs = doc.query("p")           # All <p> elements
main_div = doc.query("#main")[0]      # Element with id="main"
bold = doc.query("div > p b")         # <b> inside <p> inside <div>

# 3. Pretty-print HTML
# You can serialize any node back to HTML
print(div.to_html())
# Output:
# <div id="main">
#   <p>
#     Hello,
#     <b>world</b>
#     !
#   </p>
# </div>

# 4. Streaming API (extremely fast and memory efficient)
# For massive files or when you don't need the full DOM tree.
# NOTE: Does not build a tree and _only_ runs the html5-compatible tokenizer

from justhtml import stream

for event, data in stream(html):
    if event == "start":
        tag, attrs = data
        print(f"Start: {tag} with {attrs}")
    elif event == "text":
        print(f"Text: {data}")
    elif event == "end":
        print(f"End: {data}")

# 5. Strict mode (reject malformed HTML)
# Raises an exception on the first parse error with source highlighting
try:
    doc = JustHTML("<html><p>Hello", strict=True)
except Exception as e:
    print(e)
# Output (Python 3.11+):
#   File "<html>", line 1
#     <html><p>Hello
#                   ^
# StrictModeError: Expected closing tag </p> but reached end of file
```

### Supported CSS Selectors

JustHTML supports a comprehensive subset of CSS selectors:

| Selector | Example | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| Tag | `div` | Elements by tag name |
| Class | `.intro` | Elements with class |
| ID | `#main` | Element with ID |
| Universal | `*` | All elements |
| Attribute | `[href]` | Elements with attribute |
| Attr value | `[type="text"]` | Exact attribute match |
| Attr prefix | `[href^="https"]` | Attribute starts with |
| Attr suffix | `[href$=".pdf"]` | Attribute ends with |
| Attr contains | `[href*="example"]` | Attribute contains |
| Descendant | `div p` | `<p>` inside `<div>` |
| Child | `div > p` | Direct child |
| Adjacent | `h1 + p` | Immediately after |
| Sibling | `h1 ~ p` | Any sibling after |
| First child | `:first-child` | First child element |
| Last child | `:last-child` | Last child element |
| Nth child | `:nth-child(2n+1)` | Nth child (odd, even, formula) |
| Not | `:not(.hidden)` | Negation |
| Groups | `h1, h2, h3` | Multiple selectors |

### Command Line Interface

You can also use JustHTML from the command line to pretty-print HTML files:

```bash
# Parse a file
python -m justhtml index.html

# Parse from stdin (great for piping)
curl -s https://example.com | python -m justhtml -
```
