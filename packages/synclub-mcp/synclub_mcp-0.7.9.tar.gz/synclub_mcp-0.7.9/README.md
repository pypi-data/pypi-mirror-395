**Step 1: find your config file**
You can find your config file at:
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

Or you can find your config file in claude setting:

Click claude setting:

Edit config file:

**Step 2: append this config to your own file**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "SynClub": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
          "synclub-mcp"
      ],
      "env": {
          "SYNCLUB_MCP_API": "your api key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

If you have any problem with the command uvx, try to use the command `which uvx` to find the absolute path of uvx and replace the command in the config file.

**step 3：save and restart your claude application**
- **important：make sure to restart claude that your config file will update and check the connection in claude developer**
