name: "Invoice Match Pro"
description: "Invoice Match Pro is an end-to-end agentic workflow that automates three-way matching of invoices against Purchase Orders (POs) and Statements of Work (SOWs). The process scans a folder for unprocessed PDF invoices, extracts invoice data, performs parallel lookups for matching PO and SOW records, executes a three-way match analysis, handles human-in-the-loop decisions for invoices needing clarification, moves files to appropriate folders (approved/declined/clarification), and generates a final processing summary report."

# =============================================================================
# PIPELINE PATTERN CONFIGURATION
# =============================================================================
#
# Define the execution flow explicitly using one of three constructs:
#   - sequential: run children in order
#   - parallel: run children concurrently (wait_all)
#   - loop: repeat body up to max_iterations
#
# NODES REGISTRY (REQUIRED)
# - nodes (list[object], required)
#   - nodes[].id (str, required): agent identifier
#   - nodes[].config_file (str, required): path to agent configuration file (relative to config/)
#
# PATTERN (REQUIRED)
# - pattern (object, required): one of sequential | parallel | loop
#
# STEP (LEAF)
# - node (str, required): "agent_id"
#
# SEQUENTIAL
# - type: sequential (required)
# - steps: list of (step | pattern) (required, >=1)
#
# PARALLEL
# - type: parallel (required)
# - steps: list of (step | pattern) (required, >=1)
# - semantics: wait_all; first error fails the group (MVP defaults)
#
# LOOP
# - type: loop (required)
# - termination (object, optional): termination configuration
#   - termination.max_iterations (int | str, required): maximum iterations (integer or expression)
#   - termination.condition (str, optional): early termination condition expression
# - body: (step | sequential | parallel) (required)
#
# CONDITIONAL SEQUENTIAL
# - type: sequential (required)
# - condition (str, optional): boolean expression to evaluate before executing steps
#   - Uses expression evaluator syntax
#   - Example: "severity == 'high' OR severity == 'critical'"
# - steps: list of (step | pattern) (required, >=1)
#
# NOTES
# - Gate actions: on_approve, on_reject, on_continue, on_cancel, on_retry, on_timeout
# - Gate actions can be: continue, stop, retry_node, skip_to_node
# - Conditional steps only execute if condition evaluates to true
