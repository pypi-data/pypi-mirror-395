params:
  input_number:
    range: integer
    required: true
    examples:
      - 10
      - 100
      - 0
subtasks:
  step1:
    instructions: |
      Take the number {{input_number}} and add 1 to it.
      Store the result as a variable called result1.
      Print exactly: "Step 1 result: X" where X is the result.
      Then print COMPLETION_STATUS: COMPLETE
  step2:
    instructions: |
      Take the previous result ({{input_number}} + 1) and add 2 to it.
      Store the result as a variable called result2.
      Print exactly: "Step 2 result: Y" where Y is the result.
      Then print COMPLETION_STATUS: COMPLETE
  step3:
    instructions: |
      Take the previous result ({{input_number}} + 1 + 2) and add 3 to it.
      Store the result as a variable called result3.
      Print exactly: "Step 3 result: Z" where Z is the result.
      The final result should be {{input_number}} + 1 + 2 + 3 = {{input_number}} + 6.
      Then print COMPLETION_STATUS: COMPLETE
