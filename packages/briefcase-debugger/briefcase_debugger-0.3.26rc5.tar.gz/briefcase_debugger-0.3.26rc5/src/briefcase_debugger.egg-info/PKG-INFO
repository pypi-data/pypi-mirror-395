This package contains the debugger support package for the `pdb` and `debugpy` debuggers.

It starts the remote debugger automatically at startup through an .pth file, if a `BRIEFCASE_DEBUGGER` environment variable is set.

## Installation
As an end-user, you won't normally need to install this package. It will be installed automatically by Briefcase if you specify the `--debug=pdb` or `--debug=debugpy` option when running your application.
