# Welcome to PyKoppu

**PyKoppu** is the official Python SDK for **KOPPU** (K-dimensional Organoid Probabilistic Processing Unit), a next-generation neuromorphic computing platform.

PyKoppu allows you to solve complex optimization problems by mapping them to the physics of biological organoids.

## Key Features

- **Intuitive API**: Solve NP-hard problems with just a few lines of Python.
- **Diverse Problem Set**: Built-in support for Math, Graph, Logistics, Finance, and Energy problems.
- **Hybrid Execution**: Run simulations on CPU/GPU or connect to real KOPPU hardware.
- **Visualization**: Rich plotting tools to analyze solution dynamics.
