## 🔄 Workflow

### 1️⃣ **Configuring the parameters**
You can adjust the result by setting up your own parameters like size, margins and colors.
For more details, see [Configuration Parameters](usage/config.md).
Modify your settings inside the `config.yaml` or using the GUI:
- Image sizes (mm converted to pixels internally)
- Calendar layout
- Paths to `anniversaries.ini` and `locations.ini`
- Fonts and Colors

### 2️⃣ **Sorting Images into Folders**
Organize your images in the `images/` directory before running the generator.
You can use one of the distribution methods to distribute your plain images inside this directory
into sub-folders that represent your weekly collage content.

```plaintext
📁 images/
├── 📁 0-Title/
    ├── 2024-01-01_ski_trip.jpg
├── 📁 Week 1/
    ├── 2024-02-14_valentines_dinner in London.jpg
```

### 3️⃣ **Provide Descriptions** 🖥️
Provide descriptions for every week to describe the events.
You can use one single `description.txt` file that can be generated using the GUI
or you can put individual txt files into every single weekly sub folder.

### 4️⃣ **Setting up the birthday dates** 🎂📅
Provide the birthday information of your friends and family by using the `anniversaries.ini`

```plaintext
[Birthdays]

Paul = 6.1.1984
Peter = 08.01.99
Liz = 09.01.
Anna = 10.01.

[Weddings]
Mary & Josh = 02.01.2021    ; ⚭ Symbol is used for Weddings
```

### **Generating the Calendar** 🖼️
Use **Generate Composition** to generate all collages and one PDF file containing all your compositions.
