F2 Commander is an orthodox file manager for the modern world.

![F2 Commander Showcase](f2.png "F2 Commander Screenshot")

## Installation

From PyPI:

    pipx install f2-commander

or:

    uvx --from f2-commander f2

From source:

    uv build
    pipx install [--force] dist/f2_commander-0.8.0.tar.gz

This software is designed to work in Linux and macOS. It should also work in
WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux).

## Usage

 - Start by running `f2` in your terminal emulator
 - Hit `?` to see the built-in help
 - Hit `q` to quit

## About

F2 Commander exists to bring the experience of an orthodox file manager into
the world of modern computing.

A "file system" can be anything that can seem to contain files and directories,
(a local disk, a BLOB storage, a Cloud drive, a compressed file, etc.).

Finally, it is designed to be discoverable: making file systems easy to
navigate, and making the F2 Commander itself obvious to use.

F2 Commander is an overgrown personal project, may contain bugs, and is
provided "as is", without warranty of any kind.

## Features

 - [x] Works in Linux, macOS
 - [ ] Windows support (via WSL; should work, but to be extensively tested)
 - [x] An orthodox two-panel interface with a footer menu
 - [x] Vi-like and traditional Fn key bindings
 - [x] Command Palette (Ctrl-P)
 - [x] Rich and flexible file listing (file attributes, ordering options,
       filtering with glob, hidden files toggle, compute directory size,
       and more)
 - [x] Incremental search (type to search, fuzzy matching)
 - [ ] Recursive file search. Find in (text) files.
 - [x] Integration with native OS applications (open a directory in a file
       manager, open a file with a default program)
 - [x] File and directory manipulation (copy, move, move to trash, etc.)
 - [x] Multiple file selection
 - [x] View and edit files
 - [x] Configurable bookmarks. Quick "Go to path".
 - [x] Preview panel (text with syntax highlighting, image, and direcotry tree preview)
 - [x] Drop to shell
 - [x] User-level JSON configuration file
 - [x] Extensive "Remote File systems" support. A non-exhaustive list
       includes: AWS S3, GCP GCS, Azure ADLS, OCI, OSS, DVC, LakeFS, HDFS,
       Dropbox, Google Drive, FTP/FTPS, SFTP, SMB, WebDAV, and many more.
       Custom implementations are possible through other
       [fsspec](https://github.com/fsspec/filesystem_spec) implementations and
       plugins. \*\*See also the note below.
 - [x] Read and write archives and compressed files. A non-exhaustive
       list includes: ZIP, TAR, XAR, LHA/LZH, ISO 0660 (optical disc files),
       cpio, mtree, shar, ar, pax, RAR, MS CAB, 7-Zip, WARC, and more -
       everything supported by [libarchive](https://github.com/libarchive/libarchive).
 - [x] Multiple color themes
 - [x] Built-in help
 - [x] Built-in update check

> \*\*Remote file systems are in *preview*. All features are available,
> but not extensively tested. Connection dialog is rather crude, but is
> otherwise functional. Connections can be preconfigured in a configuration
> file.

And, hopefully, a polished up user experience that you'd normally expect from
a robust file manager. Feel free to submit any issues to make F2 Commander
even better!

## Development environment

This project uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). The configuration is
conventional, use as usual:

    uv run f2

Static code analysis and type checks (ruff, mypy) can be ran with `uvx`. For
example:

    uvx ruff check
    uvx mypy

Tests use pytest, installed with the dev dependencies:

    uv run pytest

To run all code quality controls:

    ./check

To run the application with dev tools:

    uv run textual console [-v -x SYSTEM -x EVENT -x DEBUG -x INFO]  # this first!
    uv run textual run --dev f2.main:main

To run tests in all target Python versions (typically before a release):

    ./mox

To run the latter, you need to have locally installed Python interpreters to test
with. See the `mox` implementation for a list of Python versions. Match it with
currenly supported Python versions, and update `pyproject.toml` classifiers.
`mox` is short for "my nox"; this project no longer uses nox because installing
envs with uv is so fast I don't see the point in nox anymore.

### Release process

1. Update dependencies and target Python versions (target all suppported ones).
2. Run all tests with `./mox`.
3. Update version in the `pyproject.toml`
4. Build with ``

## About (continued)

"F2" is a loose interpretation of "a **F**ile manager with **2** side-by-side
panels", and "Commander" is an homage to the old-school orthodox file managers.

"F2 Commander" is a personal project that has grown into a full-fledged file
manager and is now open-sourced. Being a personal project means that:
a) my intent is to continue the development of the features outlined above, but
   the development and bug fixing may be irregularly-paced and priorities may
   shift;
b) my intent is to keep F2 Commander stable, but future versions may include
   backward-incompatible changes where that would seem pragmatic.

## Special Thanks

F2 Commander is made with [Textual](https://github.com/textualize/textual/)
framework, [fsspec](https://github.com/fsspec/filesystem_spec) and other great
packages. Many features are made possible or stem directly from these, and I
encourage F2 Commander users to support them.
