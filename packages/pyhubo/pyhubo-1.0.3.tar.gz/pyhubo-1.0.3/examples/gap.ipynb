    "## Problem Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The Gate Assignment Problem (GAP) is a classic combinatorial optimization problem encountered in airport operations. In this example, we demonstrate how to model and solve GAP using PyHUBO's Higher-order Unconstrained Binary Optimization (HUBO) framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Context\n",
    "\n",
    "Airports need to assign arriving flights to available gates while minimizing passenger walking times and ensuring no two overlapping flights are assigned to the same gate. This is a constrained optimization problem where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Variables**: Each flight needs to be assigned to exactly one gate\n",
    "- **Objective**: Minimize total passenger walking time (passengers × walking distance to gate)\n",
    "- **Constraints**: No two overlapping flights can use the same gate\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Instance\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we'll solve a simplified GAP with:\n",
    "- **2 flights** that have overlapping time windows\n",
    "- **4 available gates** with different walking distances from the terminal\n",
    "- **Different passenger counts** for each flight\n",

    "1. Define variable domains using `VariableDictionary`\n",
    "2. Construct cost functions with `VariableAssignment`\n",
