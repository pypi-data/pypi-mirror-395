`scrapxd` is a Python library designed for web scraping, analyzing, and exporting data from [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/), the social network for cinephiles. With an intuitive, strictly-typed API using Pydantic, `scrapxd` makes it easy to access user profiles, film lists, diaries, and much more.

## Key Features

* **Scrape Whatever You Need:** Extract detailed data from user profiles, including watched films, ratings, diary entries, lists, followers, and more.
* **Film Search:** Search for films on Letterboxd based on various filters.
* **Pydantic Data Models:** All returned data is validated and structured into Pydantic models, ensuring consistency and ease of use in your code.
* **Analytics Module:** Perform statistical analysis on the collected data, such as correlations and trends (requires the `[analytics]` extra).
* **Exporting Module:** Export collected data to popular formats like CSV, JSON, and Excel (`.xlsx`) (requires the `[export]` extra).
* **Retries Logic:** Utilizes `tenacity` for automatic retries on network failures, making the scraping process more reliable.
* **Simple and Intuitive:** Designed with a clean and easy-to-use API, as demonstrated in the examples.

## Quickstart

Using `scrapxd` is very simple. Here is a basic example to get a user's watched films:

**Python**

```
from scrapxd import Scrapxd

# 1. Create a client instance
client = Scrapxd()

# 2. Get data for a Letterboxd user
# The client handles searching and pagination automatically
user = client.get_user("your_username_here")
user_films = user.logs

# 3. Access the data
print(f"Total films watched by '{user_films.username}': {user_films.number_of_entries}")

# Each entry is a Pydantic object with structured data
for entry in user_films.entries[:5]: # Displaying the first 5
    print(f"- {entry.film.title} ({entry.film.year}) - Rating: {entry.rating}")

# 4. (Optional) Export the data to an Excel file
try:
    user_films.to_xlsx(f"{user_films.username}_films")
    print(f"\nData exported to {user_films.username}_films.xlsx")
except ImportError:
    print("\nTo export data, please install with: pip install \"scrapxd[export]\"")
```
