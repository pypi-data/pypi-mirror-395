The module allows anonymizing contacts that represent natural persons
(i.e., individuals) when they are no longer needed or when a data
erasure request is received.

This module provides a method to anonymize all personally identifiable
information (PII) from a ``res.partner`` record:

- Name (e.g., replaced with initials or a generic label) for individual
  contacts
- Email address
- Phone numbers
- Street and address fields
- Tax ID
- Citizen Identification
- Job position and title
- Internal Notes
- Attached images (e.g., avatar)

The anonymization preserves the partner's link to its parent company if
applicable (e.g., for a B2B contact) but ensures that the individual is
no longer identifiable through the remaining data or relationships.

Additionally, the module removes all chatter messages (``mail.message``)
and attachments associated with the partner record, as these may contain
personal information, such as communication history, internal notes, or
file uploads. This ensures complete anonymization and supports full GDPR
compliance.

If the partner is linked to one or more ``res.users`` records (e.g., as
a portal user or employee), the module will anonymize these user
records:

- The user login and email are replaced with anonymized values, and the
  user is archived.

A log note is added to the partner record chatter to indicate the
anonymization event, supporting traceability.

Use Cases / Context
===================

This module aims to help companies comply with the European Union
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) by providing a mechanism to
anonymize personal data in ``res.partner`` records.

Configuration
=============

To permit a user to anonymize partner records:
----------------------------------------------

1. Go to **Settings** → **Users & Companies** → **Users**
2. Select the user you want to authorize
3. In the **Administration** group, enable the checkbox **"Anonymize
   Contacts"**

This will allow the user to access and execute the anonymization
functionality provided by the module.

Usage
=====

To anonymize a partner record:
------------------------------

NOTE: **Make sure the user has permission** to anonymize partner
records. Please check the Configuration file for details on how to grant
permission.

1. Go to the **Contacts App** in Odoo.
2. Select the partner record you want to anonymize.
3. Go to **Actions** → **Anonymize (GDPR)**.
4. A confirmation wizard will appear. Press the **"Confirm"** button to
   proceed.

Once you confirm, Odoo will anonymize the partner's record and all
related child records, including:

- Chatter messages and attachments
- Linked ``res.users`` (user) records, if applicable

**Important:**

- The anonymization operation **cannot be undone**.
- Please be aware that once the data is anonymized, it cannot be
  restored, so proceed carefully.
- You carry full responsibility for using the module's features, in line
  with GDPR compliance.
