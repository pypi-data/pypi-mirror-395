# World Machine Experiments

Here are the experiments conducted in the World Machine project. For more information on each specific experiment, see our [reports](https://h-iaac.github.io/WorldMachine/reports/index.html).

World Machine is a research project that investigates the concept and creation of computational world models. These AI systems create internal representations to understand and make predictions about the external world. See the [project page](https://h-iaac.github.io/WorldMachine/) for more information. The project is part of the [H.IAAC](https://hiaac.unicamp.br/en/), the Hub for Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Architecture, located at the Universidade Estadual de Campinas (UNICAMP), Brazil.
