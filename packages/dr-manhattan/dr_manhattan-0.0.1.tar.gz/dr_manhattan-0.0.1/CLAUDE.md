1. The codebase should be focused, clean, and easy to understand. Avoid emojis and other non-essential characters.
2. DO NOT create a new document. Purge unnecessary code and files.
3. Only use UV to install dependencies and run the python application.
4. Single Source of Truth: DO NOT place many variables in .env file. Place them in the code instead.
5. Run and Debug yourself PROACTIVELY.
