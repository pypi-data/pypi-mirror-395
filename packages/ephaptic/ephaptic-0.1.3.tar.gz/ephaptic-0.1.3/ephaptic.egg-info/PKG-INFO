## What is `ephaptic`?

<br>

<blockquote>
    <b>ephaptic (adj.)</b><br>
    electrical conduction of a nerve impulse across an ephapse without the mediation of a neurotransmitter.
</blockquote>

Nah, just kidding. It's an RPC framework.

> **ephaptic** — Call your backend straight from your frontend. No JSON. No latency. No middleware.

## Getting Started

- Ephaptic is designed to be invisible. Write a function on the server, call it on the client. No extra boilerplate.

- Plus, it's horizontally scalable with Redis (optional), and features extremely low latency thanks to [msgpack](https://github.com/msgpack).

- Oh, and the client can also listen to events broadcasted by the server. No, like literally. You just need to add an `eventListener`. Did I mention? Events can be sent to specific targets, specific users - not just anyone online.

What are  you waiting for? **Let's go.**

<details>
    <summary>Python</summary>
    
#### Client:

```
pip install ephaptic
```

#### Server:

```
pip install ephaptic[server]
```

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI # or `from quart import Quart`
from ephaptic import Ephaptic

app = FastAPI() # or `app = Quart(__name__)`

ephaptic = Ephaptic.from_app(app) # Finds which framework you're using, and creates an ephaptic server.
```

You can also specify a custom path:

```python
ephaptic = Ephaptic.from_app(app, path="/websocket")
```

And you can even use Redis for horizontal scaling!

```python
ephaptic = Ephaptic.from_app(app, redis_url="redis://my-redis-container:6379/0")
```

Now, how do you expose your function to the frontend?

```python
@ephaptic.expose
async def add(num1, num2):
    return num1 + num2
```

Yep, it's really that simple.

But what if your code throws an error? No sweat, it just throws up on the frontend with the same details.

And, want to say something to the frontend?

```python
await ephaptic.to(user1, user2).notification("Hello, world!", priority="high")
```

<details>
    <summary>JavaScript/TypeScript — Browser (Svelt, React, Angular, Vite, etc.)</summary>

#### To use with a framework / Vite:

```
npm install @ephaptic/client
```

Then:

```typescript
import { connect } from "@ephaptic/client";

const client = connect(); // Defaults to `/_ephaptic`.
```

Or, you can use it with a custom URL:

```typescript
const client = connect({ url: '/ws' });
```

```typescript
const client = connect({ url: 'wss://my-backend.deployment/ephaptic' });
```

You can even send auth objects to the server for identity loading.

```typescript
const client = connect({ url: '...', auth: { token: window.localStorage.getItem('jwtToken') } })
```

#### Or, to use in your browser:

```html
<script type="module">
import { connect } from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@ephaptic/client@latest/+esm';

const client = connect();
</script>
```
