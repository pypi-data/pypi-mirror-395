Welcome to Juham™ - Juha's Ultimate Home Automation Core
========================================================

Description
-----------

``juham-core`` extends the functionality of ``Masterpiece`` object by adding capabilities for MQTT
communication and integration with time series databases. The base class provides only a minimal
set of interfaces. Actual features, such as MQTT and time series database implementations — along with home
automation-specific functionalities — are provided through separate plugin modules built on ``juham-core`` class.


Project Status and Goals
------------------------

**Current State**: **Beta (Status 4)**  

The aim of Juham™ is to have fun learning Python and the GitLab ecosystem while developing a home automation framework capable of controlling all devices in Juha's home, with the potential to be adapted for other homes as well.

In its current form, Juham™ no longer stands for a “mess,” though it isn’t quite a “masterpiece” yet either. Still working hard to turn it into a masterpiece!



Special Thanks
--------------

This project would not have been possible without the generous support of two exceptional individuals: Teppo K. and Mahi.

Teppo K. provided the initial spark for this project by donating a Raspberry Pi, a temperature sensor, and giving an inspiring
demonstration of his own home automation system—effectively dragging me down the rabbit hole of endless tinkering.

Mahi has been instrumental in translating my half-baked ideas into Python code, offering invaluable support and
encouragement—while also ensuring that every time I thought I was done, I wasn’t.

Because of these two gentlemen, my already minimal spare time dropped into the negatives as I desperately tried to push the
system to some semblance of professionalism.

I’m truly grateful to both—really. 😅
