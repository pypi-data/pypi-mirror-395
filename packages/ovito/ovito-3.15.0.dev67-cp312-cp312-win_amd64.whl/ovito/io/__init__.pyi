Abstract base class for Python-based file writers. To implement a custom file writer for OVITO,
derive from this class and implement the :py:meth:`write` method. Furthermore, the class provides a number of methods that can be overridden
to specify the behavior of the file writer.

Code example:

```

Then perform the trajectory export by calling the :py:func:`export_file` function as follows:

```python
  export_file(pipeline, "output/particle_counts.txt", format=ParticleCountsWriter, multiple_frames=True)
```"""

If the file writer supports exporting trajectories, as indicated by the :py:meth:`supports_trajectories` method,
then the :py:meth:`write` method is invoked only once to export a sequence of animation frames to a single file.
The method should then iterate over all frames specified by the *frames* parameter and write them to the destination file.

If the user selected to export only a single frame, or if the user selected to export the trajectory to a sequence of

def import_file(location: Union[str, os.PathLike, Sequence[Union[str, os.PathLike]]], **params: Any) -> ovito.pipeline.Pipeline:
    """Imports data from an external file.

This Python function corresponds to the *Load File* menu command in OVITO's
user interface. The format of the imported file is automatically detected (see list of supported formats - including registered user-defined file readers).
Depending on the file's format, additional keyword parameters may be required
to specify how the data should be interpreted. These keyword parameters are documented below.

:param location: The file(s) to import. This can be a local file path or a remote *sftp://* or *https://* URL (see below).
:param params: Additional keyword parameters to be passed to the file reader. See below and the documentation of individual file readers for format-specific options.
:returns: A newly created pipeline for loading the data from disk.

The function creates and returns a new :py:class:`Pipeline` object, which uses the contents of the
external file as input. The pipeline will be wired to a :py:class:`FileSource`, which
reads the input simulation data from the external file and passes it on to the pipeline. You can access the
unmodified input data by calling :py:meth:`compute` on the pipeline's
:py:attr:`source` node.

Note that the :py:class:`Pipeline` is not automatically inserted into the three-dimensional :py:data:`~ovito.scene`.
That means the loaded data won't appear in rendered images or the interactive viewports of OVITO by default.
For that to happen, you need to explicitly insert the pipeline into the scene by calling its :py:meth:`add_to_scene` method if desired.

Furthermore, note that you can re-use the returned :py:class:`Pipeline` if you want to load a different
data file later on. Instead of calling :py:func:`import_file` again to load another file,
you can use the `pipeline.source.load(...)` method to replace the input file
of the already existing pipeline.

File data columns

When importing simple-format XYZ files or legacy *binary* LAMMPS dump files, the mapping of file columns
to particle properties in OVITO must be specified using the ``columns`` keyword parameter::

    pipeline = import_file('file.xyz', columns =
        ['Particle Identifier', 'Particle Type', 'Position.X', 'Position.Y', 'Position.Z'])

The number of column strings must match the actual number of data columns in the input file.
See this table for standard particle property names. Alternatively, you can specify
user-defined names for file columns that should be read as custom particle properties by OVITO.
For vector properties, the component name must be appended to the property's base name as demonstrated for the ``Position`` property in the example above.
To ignore a file column during import, use ``None`` as entry in the ``columns`` list.

For LAMMPS dump files or extended-format XYZ files, OVITO automatically determines a reasonable column-to-property mapping, but you may override it using the
``columns`` keyword. This can make sense, for example, if the file columns containing the particle coordinates
do not follow the standard naming scheme ``x``, ``y``, and ``z`` (as is the case when importing time-averaged atomic positions computed by LAMMPS, for example).

Frame sequences

OVITO automatically detects if the imported file contains multiple data frames (timesteps).
Alternatively (and additionally), it is possible to load a sequence of files in the same directory by using the ``*`` wildcard character
in the filename. Note that ``*`` may appear only once, only in the filename component of the path, and only in place of numeric digits.
Furthermore, it is possible to pass an explicit list of file paths to the :py:func:`import_file` function, which will be loaded
as an animatable sequence. All variants can be combined. For example, to load two file sets from different directories as one
consecutive sequence::

   import_file('sim.xyz')     # Load all frames contained in the given file
   import_file('sim.*.xyz')   # Load 'sim.0.xyz', 'sim.100.xyz', 'sim.200.xyz', etc.
   import_file(['sim_a.xyz', 'sim_b.xyz'])  # Load an explicit list of snapshot files
   import_file(['dir_a/sim.*.xyz',
                'dir_b/sim.*.xyz']) # Load several file sequences from different directories

The number of frames found in the input file(s) is reported by the :py:attr:`num_frames` attribute of the pipeline's :py:class:`FileSource`
You can step through the frames with a ``for``-loop as follows:

```python
  from ovito.io import import_file
  
  # Import a sequence of files.
  pipeline = import_file('input/simulation.*.dump')
  
  # Loop over all frames of the sequence.
  # The iterator calls compute() on the FileSource to load each frame into memory
  # and return the data as a new DataCollection:
  for data in pipeline.frames:
  
      # The source path and the index of the current frame
      # are attached as attributes to the data collection:
      print('Frame source:', data.attributes['SourceFile'])
      print('Frame index:', data.attributes['SourceFrame'])
  
      # Accessing the loaded frame data, e.g the particle positions:
      print(data.particles.positions[...])
```

LAMMPS atom style

When loading a LAMMPS data file, the atom style may have to be specified using the ``atom_style`` keyword parameter unless the file contains
a hint string, which allows OVITO to detect the style automatically. Data files written by the LAMMPS ``write_data`` command or by OVITO contain such a hint, for example.
For data files not containing a hint, the atom style must be specified explicitly as in these examples::

   import_file('full_model.data', atom_style = 'full')
   import_file('hybrid_model.data', atom_style = 'hybrid', atom_substyles = ('template', 'charge'))

Particle ordering

Particles are read and stored by OVITO in the same order as they are listed in the input file.
Some file formats contain unique particle identifiers or tags which allow OVITO to track individual particles
over time even if the storage order changes from frame to frame. OVITO will automatically make use of that
information where appropriate without touching the original storage order. However, in some situations it may be
desirable to explicitly have the particles sorted with respect to the IDs. You can request this
reordering by passing the ``sort_particles=True`` option to :py:func:`import_file`. Note that this option
is without effect if the input file contains no particle identifiers.

Topology and trajectory files

Some simulation codes write a *topology* file and separate *trajectory* file. The former contains only static information like the bonding
between atoms, the atom types, etc., which do not change during a simulation run, while the latter stores the varying data (primarily
the atomic trajectories). To load such a topology-trajectory pair of files, first read the topology file with
the :py:func:`import_file` function, then insert a :py:class:`LoadTrajectoryModifier` into the returned :py:class:`Pipeline`
to also load the trajectory data.

Remote file access via SSH and HTTPS

Some builds of the OVITO Python module support loading files from remote servers via the SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) or HTTPS protocol.
To load a file from a remote server, specify the file's URL in the form ``sftp://username@host/path/to/file`` or ``https://host/path/to/file``.
If necessary, the user will be prompted for the password to access the remote server. Alternatively, the password can be provided as part of the URL
(separated by a colon after the username). On some platforms, two different SSH connection methods are supported by OVITO: the built-in SSH client implementation (libssh)
and the external OpenSSH client program, which is available on many systems. You can select the desired SSH client implementation by setting the environment variable ``OVITO_SSH_METHOD``
to either `"libssh"` or `"openssh"`. The environment variable ``OVITO_SSH_LOG=1`` can be useful to debug connection problems.

Explicit file format specification

Normally, OVITO detects the format of the imported file(s) automatically. In rare cases, however, the auto-detection mechanism may fail.
Then you can explicitly specify the file format using the optional ``input_format`` keyword parameter. It must one of the following
supported format identifiers:
``"ca"``, ``"castep/cell"``, ``"castep/md"``, ``"cfg"``, ``"cif"``, ``"dcd"``, ``"dlpoly"``, ``"fhi-aims"``, ``"fhi-aims/log"``, ``"galamost"``,
``"gaussian/cube"``, ``"gro"``, ``"gsd/hoomd"``, ``"imd"``, ``"lammps/data"``, ``"lammps/dump"``, ``"lammps/dump/bin"``, ``"lammps/dump/grid"``, ``"lammps/dump/local"``, ``"lammps/dump/yaml"``,
``"mercurydpm"``, ``"mmcif"``, ``"mol/sdf"``, ``"netcdf/amber"``, ``"obj"``, ``"oxdna"``, ``"parcas"``, ``"pdb"``, ``"quantumespresso"``, ``"reaxff/bonds"``,
``"stl"``, ``"vasp"``, ``"vtk/legacy/mesh"``, ``"vtk/pvd"``, ``"vtk/vti/grid"``, ``"vtk/vtm"``, ``"vtk/vtp/mesh"``, ``"vtk/vtp/particles"``,
``"vtk/vts/grid"``, ``"xsf"``, ``"xtc"``, ``"xyz"``.
Alternatively, ``input_format`` may specify a :py:class:`FileReaderInterface` class or object.

def export_file(data: Union[ovito.pipeline.Pipeline, ovito.data.DataObject, None], file: Union[str, os.PathLike], format: Union[str, Type[FileWriterInterface]], **params: Any) -> None:
    """Writes data to an output file. See section :ref:`file_output_overview` for an overview.

:param data: The object to be exported. See available options below.
:param file: The output file path.
:param format: The kind of file to write. See available options below.
:param params: Optional keyword arguments depending on the selected format.

Exportable objects

The following kinds of Python objects can be passed to this function:

:py:class:`Pipeline`
    If you provide a data pipeline, the dynamically computed output of the pipeline gets exported. Since pipelines support evaluation at different animation times,
    a sequence of frames can be exported by passing the extra keyword argument ``multiple_frames=True``, see below.

:py:class:`DataCollection`
    If you provide a data collection, the static snapshot stored in the collection is exported.
    Note that it depends on the selected file format which objects from the data collection will be exported -
    or you may have to provide extra function arguments to specify which data object(s) to export.

:py:class:`DataObject`
    If you provide a single data object, e.g. a :py:class:`DataTable` or :py:class:`SurfaceMesh`,
    just that one object gets exported. The behavior is similar to providing a :py:class:`DataCollection`
    containing a single data object.

`None`
    This exports the entire visualization scene, i.e. the output of all data pipelines in the current scene (see :py:attr:`ovito.Scene.pipelines` list).
    This option is currently supported only by the glTF and POV-Ray exporters, which generate a full scene description file.

Additional keyword parameters, as documented below, let you control which aspects of a dataset will be written to the output file.
For instance, for some file formats the ``columns`` keyword controls the set of particle properties to be exported.

Output filename

The parameter *file* specifies the path of the output file. If the filename ends with the suffix `.gz`,
the output file will be compressed using the zlib library to save disk space (works only for text-based file formats).

If a wildcard "*" character appears in the filename, then one file per animation frame is written and the "*" character is replaced
with the frame number. This feature is typically used in conjunction with the ``multiple_frames=True`` option, see below.

Output formats

The parameter *format* may be one of the following strings selecting the kind of file to write (list of supported file formats):

============================= ========================================================================

Alternatively, *format* may be a Python class derived from :py:class:`FileWriterInterface` that implements a custom file writer.
Depending on the selected output format, additional keyword arguments may be passed to :py:func:`export_file` as documented in the following sections.

File columns

For output formats *lammps/dump*, *xyz*, *imd*, and *netcdf/amber* you must specify the list of particle properties to be exported
by providing the ``columns`` keyword argument::

    export_file(pipeline, "output.xyz", "xyz", columns =
      ["Particle Identifier", "Particle Type", "Position.X", "Position.Y", "Position.Z"])

When exporting a vectorial property, you can specify a particular vector component by appending it as a suffix
to the base name, e.g. ``"Position.Z"`` or ``"Atomic Strain.XY"`` (see `Property.component_names`).
If you do not specify a component, all components of the vector property will be exported in the form of several consecutive data columns (since OVITO 3.8).

.. tip::

    If you are not sure which particle properties are available for export, you can print the list of particle properties
    to the console as follows::

       print(pipeline.compute().particles)

Exporting several simulation frames

By default, only the current animation frame (frame 0 by default) is exported.
To export a different trajectory frame, pass the ``frame`` keyword parameter to the :py:func:`export_file` function.
Alternatively, you can export all frames of the animation sequence at once by specifying ``multiple_frames=True``.
More refined control is possible through the keyword arguments ``start_frame``, ``end_frame``, and ``every_nth_frame``.

Some file formats such as *lammps/dump*, *xyz*, *gsd/hoomd* or *netcdf/amber* can store all frames of the exported trajectory
in a single output file. For other formats, or if you prefer one file per frame, you must pass a filename pattern
to :py:func:`export_file`. The specified output filename must contain a ``*`` wildcard character as in the following example,
which will be replaced with the animation frame number during export::

    export_file(pipeline, "output.*.dump", "lammps/dump", multiple_frames=True)

This is equivalent to an explicit for-loop that exports the frames one by one to a series of files::

    for i in range(pipeline.num_frames):
        export_file(pipeline, f"output.{i}.dump", "lammps/dump", frame=i)

Floating-point number precision

For text-based file formats, you can specify the desired formatting precision for floating-point values using the
``precision`` keyword parameter. The default output precision is 10 digits; the maximum is 17.

LAMMPS atom style

When writing files in the *lammps/data* format, the LAMMPS atom style "atomic" is used by default. To generate
a data file with a different `LAMMPS atom style <https://docs.lammps.org/atom_style.html>`__, specify it using the ``atom_style`` keyword parameter::

    export_file(pipeline, "output.data", "lammps/data", atom_style="bond")
    export_file(pipeline, "output.data", "lammps/data", atom_style="hybrid", atom_substyles=("template", "charge"))

If at least one :py:class:`ParticleType` of the exported model has a non-zero :py:attr:`mass` value,
OVITO writes a ``Masses`` section to the LAMMPS data file. You can suppress it by passing ``omit_masses=True`` to the export function.

The option ``ignore_identifiers=True`` replaces any existing atom IDs (particle property `Particle Identifier`) with a new contiguous sequence of numeric IDs during export.
The option ``consecutive_type_ids=True`` replaces existing numeric type IDs of particle/bond/angle/dihedral/improper types with new values during export.
The option ``export_type_names=True`` writes the names of OVITO particle/bond/angle/dihedral/improper types to the data file as LAMMPS type maps.

LAMMPS triclinic simulation cell format

OVITO can export *lammps/dump* and *lammps/data* files using either the restricted or the new general `triclinic format <https://docs.lammps.org/Howto_triclinic.html#general-triclinic-simulation-boxes-in-lammps>`__.
The option can be toggled using the ``restricted_triclinic`` keyword parameter. Currently this option defaults to ``True``, maintaining backward compatibility with previous versions of OVITO and LAMMPS.

**VASP (POSCAR) format**

When exporting to the *vasp* file format, OVITO will output atomic positions and velocities in Cartesian coordinates by default.
You can request output in reduced cell coordinates by specifying the ``reduced`` keyword parameter::

    export_file(pipeline, "structure.poscar", "vasp", reduced=True)

Global attributes

The *txt/attr* file format allows you to write global quantities computed by the data pipeline to a text file.
For example, here is how you export the number of FCC atoms identified by a :py:class:`CommonNeighborAnalysisModifier`
as a function of simulation time to a simple text file::

    export_file(pipeline, "data.txt", "txt/attr",
        columns=["Timestep", "CommonNeighborAnalysis.counts.FCC"],
        multiple_frames=True)

.. tip::

    If you are not sure which global attributes are available for export, you can print the list of :py:attr:`attributes`
    produced by your current data pipeline to the console::

       print(pipeline.compute().attributes)"""
    ...
