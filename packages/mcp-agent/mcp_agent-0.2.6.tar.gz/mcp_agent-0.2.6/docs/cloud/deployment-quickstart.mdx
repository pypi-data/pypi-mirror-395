## TL;DR

```bash
uvx mcp-agent login
uvx mcp-agent deploy my-agent
uvx mcp-agent cloud servers describe my-agent
```

That is enough to put any MCP application—`mcp-agent` workflow, FastMCP server, or ChatGPT App backend—online. Deployments automatically run on the managed Temporal cluster; you do **not** need to configure Temporal hosts or queues yourself.

The sections below add a little context and point to deeper guides when you are ready.

## 1. Authenticate (one time)

```bash
uvx mcp-agent login
```

The CLI opens a browser window so you can sign in with GitHub or Google and generate an API key. Credentials are cached under `~/.mcp-agent/credentials.json`. In CI, set the `MCP_API_KEY` environment variable instead.

## 2. Confirm your project layout

Minimal structure:

```
my-agent/
├── main.py
├── mcp_agent.config.yaml
└── (optional) mcp_agent.secrets.yaml
```

`mcp_agent.config.yaml` just needs to describe your app. You can keep `execution_engine: temporal` if you already use it locally, but the cloud service will always launch your code on Temporal automatically.

Example:

```yaml mcp_agent.config.yaml
name: web_summarizer
logger:
  transports: [console]

mcp:
  servers:
    fetch:
      command: "uvx"
      args: ["mcp-server-fetch"]

openai:
  default_model: gpt-4o
```

If your app needs API keys, either place them in `mcp_agent.secrets.yaml` or declare them in the `env` list inside `mcp_agent.config.yaml` so the CLI captures values from your shell. See [Manage secrets](/cloud/mcp-agent-cloud/manage-secrets) for full guidance.

## 3. Deploy

```bash
uvx mcp-agent deploy web-summarizer
```

The CLI bundles the current directory, prompts you to classify secrets (deployment vs. user), uploads the bundle, and provisions the runtime. On success you will see something like:

```
✓ Deployed app ID: app_abc123xyz
   Server URL: https://app_abc123xyz.deployments.mcp-agent.com
   Status: ONLINE
```

Redeploy with the same name to ship updates. Useful flags:

- `--config-dir <path>` – deploy from another directory.
- `--non-interactive` – reuse stored secrets (CI/CD).
- `--dry-run` – validate without uploading.

> Deployment emits both `mcp_agent.deployed.secrets.yaml` (secret handles and env references) and `mcp_agent.deployed.config.yaml` (materialized settings). Commit them if you want reproducible bundles.

## 4. Check status & logs

```bash
uvx mcp-agent cloud servers describe app_abc123xyz
uvx mcp-agent cloud logger tail app_abc123xyz --follow
```

`describe` prints the endpoint, auth mode, and worker status. `logger tail` streams application logs; add `--since 30m` or `--grep "ERROR"` as needed. All other operational commands are listed on the [cloud overview](/cloud/mcp-agent-cloud/overview).

## 5. Configure clients

Most deployments need per-user credentials. Prompt users (or your CI job) with:

```bash
uvx mcp-agent cloud configure --id https://app_abc123xyz.deployments.mcp-agent.com
```

Then install the server into your favourite MCP client:

- **Claude Desktop / Cursor / VS Code / ChatGPT** – `uvx mcp-agent install --client <client> https://app_abc123xyz.deployments.mcp-agent.com/sse`
- **ChatGPT Apps** – deploy with `--no-auth` and register the SSE endpoint in the Apps dashboard.
- **Python** – add the server endpoint to your MCP client config ([see guide](/cloud/mcp-agent-cloud/use-deployed-server)).

To inspect or rotate deployment-time environment secrets later, use `uvx mcp-agent cloud env list|add|remove|pull`. These commands operate on the same handles created during deploy and are safe to run from CI.
