This module extends the Account Payment Terms functionality by
introducing the fields: *has_cutoff_day*, *months*, and *cutoff_day* in
``account.payment.term.line``.

With this feature, users can define a specific cutoff day for payment
terms. If an invoice is dated after this cutoff day, the system will
automatically shift the due date by one additional month.

The *months* field allows users to specify how many months should be
added to the invoice date when calculating the due date.

It also adds the cutoff_date field in account.move.
