# Ensure file permissions are set appropriately (e.g., chmod 600 on Unix systems)

                       # true: print sends async IPC messages (for LLM visibility)
                       # false: print uses console output (show)

# Add more servers as needed:
# [servers.prod]

# user = "devuser"
# password = "dev-password-here"
# print_to_async = true
