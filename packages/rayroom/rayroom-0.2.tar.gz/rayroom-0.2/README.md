## Features

- **Ray Tracing Engine**: Stochastic ray tracing for late reflections.
- **Image Source Method (ISM)**: Deterministic early specular reflections.
- **Acoustic Radiosity**: Modeling of diffuse field energy exchange between surfaces.
- **FDTD Wave Solver**: Accurate low-frequency wave simulation using Finite Difference Time Domain.
- **Hybrid Rendering**: Combines methods for optimal accuracy and performance (ISM + Ray Tracing).
- **Spectral Rendering**: Frequency-dependent strategy using Wave equation for low frequencies and Geometric methods for high frequencies.
- **Room Creation**: Create shoebox rooms or complex polygons from corner lists.
- **Materials**: Frequency-dependent absorption, transmission (transparency), and scattering coefficients.
- **Objects**: Support for furniture, people (blockers), sources, and receivers (microphones).

## Physics & Rendering

RayRoom implements multiple rendering strategies to model sound propagation accurately across different frequency bands and acoustic phenomena.

### 1. Ray Tracing (Stochastic)
Models sound as particles (rays) that bounce around the room.
- **Geometric Divergence**: Naturally handled by the divergence of rays.
- **Air Absorption**: ISO 9613-1 standard model based on temperature, humidity, and pressure.
- **Scattering**: Walls scatter rays based on their scattering coefficient.

### 2. Image Source Method (ISM)
Models specular reflections by mirroring sources across boundaries.
- **Purpose**: Captures precise early reflections (echoes) that are crucial for spatial perception.
- **Deterministic**: Unlike ray tracing, it finds exact reflection paths up to a specified order.

### 3. Acoustic Radiosity
A patch-based energy exchange method.
- **Purpose**: Models the late diffuse reverberation field.
- **Mechanism**: Divides walls into patches and solves the energy transfer matrix (view factors) to simulate diffuse inter-reflections.

### 4. Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD)
Solves the acoustic wave equation on a 3D grid.
- **Purpose**: Accurate simulation of low-frequency phenomena like standing waves, diffraction, and interference which geometric methods (Ray/ISM) miss.
- **Mechanism**: Voxelizes the room and updates pressure fields over time steps.

### 5. Hybrid Engines
- **Hybrid Renderer**: Combines ISM (Early) and Ray Tracing (Late) for a complete impulse response.
- **Spectral Renderer**: Splits the audio spectrum. Uses **FDTD** for low frequencies (Wave physics) and **Hybrid Geometric** (ISM+Ray) for high frequencies.

## Installation

You can install RayRoom directly from PyPI:

```bash
pip install rayroom
```

Or install from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rayroom/rayroom.git
cd rayroom
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

### Simple Shoebox Room with Audio Rendering

```python
from rayroom import Room, Source, Receiver, AudioRenderer
import scipy.io.wavfile as wavfile
import numpy as np

# Create Room
room = Room.create_shoebox([5, 4, 3])

# Add Source and Receiver
source = Source("Speaker", [1, 1, 1.5])
room.add_source(source)
room.add_receiver(Receiver("Mic", [4, 3, 1.5]))

# Setup Audio Renderer
renderer = AudioRenderer(room, fs=44100)

# Assign Audio to Source (requires an input wav file)
renderer.set_source_audio(source, "input.wav")

# Run Simulation
outputs = renderer.render(n_rays=10000)

# Save Result
mixed_audio = outputs["Mic"]
if mixed_audio is not None:
    wavfile.write("output.wav", 44100, (mixed_audio * 32767).astype(np.int16))
```

### Hybrid Rendering (ISM + Ray Tracing)

Use the `HybridRenderer` to combine deterministic early reflections with stochastic late reverberation.

```python
from rayroom.hybrid import HybridRenderer

# ... setup room ...

renderer = HybridRenderer(room, fs=44100)
renderer.set_source_audio(source, "input.wav")

# ism_order=2 calculates exact reflections up to 2 bounces
outputs = renderer.render(n_rays=20000, ism_order=2)
```

### Spectral Rendering (Wave + Geometric)

Use the `SpectralRenderer` for high-fidelity simulation that accounts for wave physics at low frequencies.

```python
from rayroom.spectral import SpectralRenderer

# ... setup room ...

# crossover_freq determines where to switch from Wave to Geometric physics
renderer = SpectralRenderer(room, fs=44100, crossover_freq=1000)
renderer.set_source_audio(source, "input.wav")

outputs = renderer.render(rir_duration=1.0)
```

### Radiosity Rendering (ISM + Diffuse Energy)

Use `RadiosityRenderer` for smooth diffuse tails without ray sampling noise.

```python
from rayroom.render_radiosity import RadiosityRenderer

# ... setup room ...

renderer = RadiosityRenderer(room, fs=44100, patch_size=0.5)
renderer.set_source_audio(source, "input.wav")

outputs = renderer.render(ism_order=2)
```
