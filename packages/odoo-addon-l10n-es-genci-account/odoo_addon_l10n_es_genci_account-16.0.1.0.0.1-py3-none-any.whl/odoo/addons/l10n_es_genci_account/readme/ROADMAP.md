Pending Features:

- **Multi-company:** Confirm whether GENCI rules should support multi-company logic, and ensure each rule is linked to its respective company with coherent application logic.

- **Currency:** Validate whether GENCI rules can be configured in different currencies or only in euros.

- **Supplier association:** Determine if each GENCI rule should be linked to a specific supplier, and consider if multiple rules could exist for the same product depending on the supplier.

- **Product GENCI flag type:** Consider changing the genci_subject field on product.template from a selection (yes/no) to a Boolean is_genci field for simplicity and consistency in the code.
