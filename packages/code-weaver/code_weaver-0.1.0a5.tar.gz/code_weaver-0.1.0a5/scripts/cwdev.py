"""
Planned helper tool.
TODO: The plan for this script is to make it an overall dev helper to do things like:
- use cyclopts as a cli tool for these tasks (below).
- print a table of `mise run` commands for the project.
- guide users through the various /scripts/ available.
- provide information on how to add new scripts.
- eventually: scaffold new stuff for the project.
