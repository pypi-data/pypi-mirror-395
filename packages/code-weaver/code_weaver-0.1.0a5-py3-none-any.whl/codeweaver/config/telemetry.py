Telemetry configuration settings.

Configuration sources (priority order):
1. Environment Variables (set in your shell or env file, in that order)
2. CodeWeaver configuration (see `CodeWeaverSettings` for priority order)
3. Defaults defined in `TelemetrySettings`, which are:
    disable_telemetry: false
    tools_over_privacy: false  (i.e., privacy first)
    posthog_project_key: CodeWeaver's PostHog key (not an API key)
    posthog_host: https://us.i.posthog.com
    batch_size: 10
    batch_interval_seconds: 60

Environment Variables:
    CODEWEAVER__TELEMETRY__DISABLE_TELEMETRY
    CODEWEAVER__TELEMETRY__TOOLS_OVER_PRIVACY
    CODEWEAVER__TELEMETRY__POSTHOG_PROJECT_KEY
    CODEWEAVER__TELEMETRY__POSTHOG_HOST

                - hash file paths and repository names,
                - screen out potential secrets,
                - don't collect any queries or results content (unless you explicitly tell us we can, see `value_tools_more_than_privacy`).
            If enabled, we **DO collect**:
                - usage patterns,
                - errors,
                - performance metrics,
                - settings usage (e.g., which providers you use, whether you explicitly set certain settings, etc).
            Well, technically we don't collect anything yet -- telemetry isn't wired up -- but when we do, this is what we will collect. This helps us make CodeWeaver better for everyone.  **We will never sell your data or show you ads. We only use it to improve CodeWeaver.**
    We pass all data we collect through filters in CodeWeaver before we send it to PostHog, and at PostHog, we have additional filters set up at the entry point (before we can see it) to further ensure we don't collect any potentially identifying information.

            3. install CodeWeaver with the `codeweaver[recommended-no-telemetry]` extra, or use the a-la-carte install with `codeweaver[required-core]` and your choice of providers (like, `codeweaver[required-core,cli,provider-anthropic,provider-fastembed,provider-azure]`) to install without telemetry
            4. Point the `CODEWEAVER__TELEMETRY__POSTHOG_PROJECT_KEY` environment variable to your own Posthog project (if you're a data nerd, or want to collect internal telemetry for your organization). If you disable telemetry, we won't collect any data at all."""

Because of the nature of searches and results and codebases, we can't guarantee complete anonymity -- but we will do our best to filter out any potential secrets or PII, using multiple filters both in CodeWeaver and on ingest at Posthog. We will hash file paths and repository names, and we won't collect any raw queries or result content. This data will help us improve CodeWeaver's search algorithms, agent prompting, ranking, and overall user experience. If you care about making CodeWeaver better and are OK with us collecting this data, please enable this setting. If you value your privacy more than helping us improve CodeWeaver; that's cool too -- you can just leave this setting disabled."""
