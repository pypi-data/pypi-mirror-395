Community Edition
In addition to the General Terms of Service below, by using the Silent Push Community Edition, you agree to the following terms;

A. Definitions. For the purposes of these Community Edition terms:

“Evaluation Term” means the term during which you may use the Service, as agreed to by you and Silent Push.
“Non-Production Environment” means isolated systems and datasets created solely for testing, development, or staging, using synthetic, redacted, or de- identified data, and not accessible by external end users.
“Production Use” means use of the Service (i) to process live, operational, or customer-identifiable data; (ii) in workflows relied upon by end users other than test users; (iii) for external-facing or customer-facing functionality; (iv) to support revenue-generating or business-critical activities; or (v) at volumes, concurrency, or availability levels characteristic of normal business operations.
B. Non-Production Use Only. You may access the Service solely for internal evaluation, testing, proof-of-concept, and development in a Non-Production Environment. You agree that you will not use the Service to support any Production-related business operations, provide access to external users, or perform real transactions. Production Use is prohibited unless and until you upgrade to a paid plan that expressly permits such use. You acknowledge and agree that you will not use the Service for Production Use. Any Production Use is prohibited and may result in immediate suspension and the assessment of fees as set forth below, and/or legal action. The foregoing shall not apply to students or individual analysts.

C. Monitoring and Suspension. Silent Push may limit access or features, or suspend free tier access at any time. You agree to pay for an upgrade to the Production version at the then-current list price should you use the Community Edition for Production purposes.

Silent Push may monitor usage signals to verify compliance. Silent Push may request a written attestation and may suspend access immediately upon a good-faith belief of Production Use, and/or invoice you at then current list price. In such event, you agree to pay for the period of Production Use.

D. Evaluation License. Silent Push grants you a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non- transferable right to use the Service solely for internal evaluation and testing in a Non- Production Environment during the Evaluation Term.

E. Additional Restrictions. You will not (i) deploy agents/connectors from the Service into systems designed, intended or used for Production Use; (ii) integrate the Service with payment flows or messaging designed, intended or used for Production Use; (iii) use the Service to make decisions affecting real customers or employees; or (iv) represent the Service as generally available.

F. Consequences of Breach. If you engage in Production Use, then (i) the evaluation license automatically converts to the then-current paid plan appropriate for such use, and fees will apply retroactively from the first date of Production Use; and (ii) Silent Push may pursue all other remedies available at law or equity, including injunctive relief.

G. No SLA; Data Handling. The evaluation Service is provided without uptime commitments, support SLAs, or data retention guarantees. Test data may be deleted at any time. You are solely responsible for backing up any test artifacts. The Service is offered as-is; see Section 16 of the General Terms for more information.

b. Billing. Silent Push bills you through an online account (your “Billing Account”) for use of the Service. You agree to pay all charges at the prices then in effect for any use of the Service by you or other persons (including your agents) using your Billing Account, and you authorize Silent Push to charge your chosen payment provider (your “Payment Method”) for the Service. You agree to make payment using that selected Payment Method. c. Payment Method. The terms of your payment will be based on your Payment Method and may be determined by agreements between you and the financial institution, credit card issuer or other provider of your chosen payment method.

d. Recurring Billing. Our subscription plans to the Service consist of an initial period, for which there is a one-time charge, followed by recurring period charges as agreed to by you. By entering into this Agreement, you acknowledge that your subscription has an initial and recurring payment feature and you accept responsibility for all recurring charges prior to cancellation. Silent Push may submit periodic charges (e.g. yearly) without further authorization from you, until you provide prior notice (confirmed in writing by Silent Push) that you have terminated this authorization or wish to change your payment method. Such notice will not affect charges submitted before Silent Push could reasonably act. You may change your payment method or cancel your paid membership by a provider of your chosen Payment Method (the “Payment Method Provider”) in your account settings on the Websites. For your convenience, we take your payment information so that your Silent Push membership will not be interrupted. We auto-renew your membership at the level you selected. Your Silent Push subscription will be automatically extended for successive renewal periods of the same duration as the subscription term originally selected, at the then-current non-promotional subscription rate (if applicable).

CHANGES TO SUCH INFORMATION CAN BE MADE AT ACCOUNT SETTINGS. IF YOU FAIL TO PROVIDE SILENT PUSH ANY OF THE FOREGOING INFORMATION, YOU AGREE THAT SILENT PUSH MAY CONTINUE CHARGING YOU FOR ANY USE OF THE SERVICE UNDER YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT UNLESS YOU HAVE TERMINATED YOUR SUBSCRIPTION FOR THE SERVICE (CONFIRMED BY YOU IN WRITING UPON REQUEST BY SILENT PUSH). f. Payment Method. The terms of your payment will be based on your Payment Method and may be determined by agreements between you and the financial institution, credit card issuer or other provider of your chosen payment method.  g. Reaffirmation of Authorization. Your non-termination or continued use of the Service reaffirms that Silent Push is authorized to charge your Payment Method. Silent Push may submit those charges for payment and you will be responsible for such charges. This does not waive Silent Push’s right to seek payment directly from you. Your charges may be payable in advance, in arrears, per usage, or as otherwise described when you initially subscribed to the Service.
