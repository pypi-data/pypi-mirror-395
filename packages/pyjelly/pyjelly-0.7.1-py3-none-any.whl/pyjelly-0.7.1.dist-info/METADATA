# pyjelly

**pyjelly** is a Python implementation of [Jelly](http://w3id.org/jelly), a high-performance binary serialization format and streaming protocol for RDF knowledge graphs.

**Documentation, usage guide and more: https://w3id.org/jelly/pyjelly**

## Features

- **Fast reading and writing** of RDF knowledge graphs in the [Jelly format](http://w3id.org/jelly).
- **Standalone [generic API](https://w3id.org/jelly/pyjelly/dev/generic-sink)** with no third-party dependencies, allowing for:
    - Serialization and parsing of statements to and from Jelly files.
    - Parsing and serializing streams of graphs and statements.
- Precise control over **serialization options, framing and compression**.
- **Seamless** integration with: 
    - **[rdflib](https://w3id.org/jelly/pyjelly/dev/getting-started)**
    - **[RDFLib-Neo4j](https://w3id.org/jelly/pyjelly/dev/rdflib-neo4j-integration)**
    - **[NetworkX](https://w3id.org/jelly/pyjelly/dev/networkx-integration)**
- **Stream processing support** for large datasets or streams of all [physical stream types](https://w3id.org/jelly/dev/specification/reference/#physicalstreamtype).

**pyjelly** is useful when dealing with (see [full description](https://w3id.org/jelly/pyjelly/dev/overview/#use-cases)):

- Dumping and loading **large RDF datasets**.
- **Client-server communication**.
- Workflows, where **streaming** is required.

## Getting started

Install pyjelly from **[PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pyjelly/)**:

```bash
pip install pyjelly[rdflib]
```

To write an RDF graph to a Jelly file:

```python
from rdflib import Graph

g = Graph()
g.parse("http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/index.rdf")
g.serialize(destination="foaf.jelly", format="jelly")
```

To read a Jelly file and convert it to an rdflib `Graph`:

```python
from rdflib import Graph

g = Graph()
g.parse("foaf.jelly", format="jelly")
```

**See [our documentation](https://w3id.org/jelly/pyjelly) for [further examples](https://w3id.org/jelly/pyjelly/dev/getting-started/), a full [API reference](https://w3id.org/jelly/pyjelly/dev/api), and more.**
