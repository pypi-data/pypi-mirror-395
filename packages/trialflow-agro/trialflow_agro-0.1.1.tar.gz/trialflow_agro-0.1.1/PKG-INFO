# trialflow-agro  
A lightweight, reproducible workflow template for analyzing on-farm agricultural trials.

`trialflow-agro` provides a simple structure for loading trial data, running configurable analyses, and generating clear summaries and reports.

---

## 🌾 What This Project Is
- A starter framework for agricultural trial analysis  
- A clean, reproducible layout for future research software  
- CLI-based workflow (conceptual)  
- Designed for JOSS-style publications  

This repo does **not** include implementation details yet — only the structure and documentation.
