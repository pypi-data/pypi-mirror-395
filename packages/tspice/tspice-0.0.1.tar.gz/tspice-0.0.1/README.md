# TSPICE

Tidal Signal with Python and SPICE

## Description

`TSPICE` is a Python package developed for my Bachelor's thesis, "Tidal Potential: Calculations". It is designed to calculate tidal potentials and signals on Earth and other bodies, generated by other external bodies, using NASA's SPICE toolkit for high-precision ephemeris calculations.

## Installation

```bash
pip install tspice
