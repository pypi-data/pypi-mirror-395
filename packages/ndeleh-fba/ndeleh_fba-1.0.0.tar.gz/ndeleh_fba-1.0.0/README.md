# 🐟 Ndeleh Fish Bone Algorithm (N-FBA)

**Created by Ndeleh (2025)**  
A biologically-inspired associative intelligence algorithm that adapts its shape based on the structure of data.

N-FBA models human recall by building:

- A dynamic **spine** (main associative path)
- **Ribs** (secondary associations)
- **Micro-ribs** (deep background associations)
- An emergent **morphology** describing the final skeletal form

N-FBA works like a brain forming memories:
you see something → it reminds you of something related → which triggers something else.

## 🔥 Features

- 🧠 **Dynamic Spine Builder**  
  Finds the strongest associative path in a graph.

- 🦴 **Rib + Micro-Rib Expansion**  
  Multi-level branching using decaying activation.

- 🎨 **Adaptive Morphology**  
  Output changes shape depending on data:
  - linear
  - rib-heavy
  - curved
  - clustered
  - sparse

- 🐍 **Python Library**  
  Import and run in your code.

- 💻 **Command Line Tool**  
  Run from terminal using:
  ```bash
  nfb --seed A
