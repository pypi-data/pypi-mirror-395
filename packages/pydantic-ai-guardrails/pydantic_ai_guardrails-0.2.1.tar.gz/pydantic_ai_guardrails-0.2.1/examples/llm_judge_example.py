"""LLM-as-a-Judge Example

Demonstrates the llm_judge guardrail that uses a separate LLM to evaluate
the quality of outputs. This is the most flexible guardrail as it can evaluate
any aspect of quality using natural language criteria.

This example shows:
1. Single criterion evaluation
2. Multiple criteria evaluation
3. Binary vs scored evaluation
4. Custom evaluation prompts
5. Context-aware judging
6. Real-world use cases (quality assurance, compliance, brand voice)
