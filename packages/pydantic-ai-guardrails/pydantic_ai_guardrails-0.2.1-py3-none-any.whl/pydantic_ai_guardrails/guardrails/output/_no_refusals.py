    """Create an output guardrail that blocks LLM refusals.

    Detects when the model refuses to answer a request with phrases like
    "I cannot help with that" or "I'm not able to". Useful for ensuring
    the model actually attempts to answer questions rather than refusing.

    Args:
        patterns: Custom refusal pattern(s) to detect (regex). If None,
            uses comprehensive default patterns covering common refusals.
            Can be a single pattern string or list of patterns.
        case_sensitive: If True, matching is case-sensitive.
            If False (default), matching is case-insensitive.
        allow_partial_refusals: If True, only block if the ENTIRE response
            is a refusal (no substantive content). If False (default),
            block any response containing refusal patterns.
        min_response_length: When allow_partial_refusals=True, responses
            shorter than this are considered "complete refusals" even if
            they don't match patterns. Default: 20 characters.

    Returns:
        OutputGuardrail configured to detect refusals.

    Example:
        ```python
        from pydantic_ai import Agent
        from pydantic_ai_guardrails import GuardedAgent
        from pydantic_ai_guardrails.guardrails.output import no_refusals

        agent = Agent('openai:gpt-4o')

        # Block any refusals
        guarded_agent = GuardedAgent(
            agent,
            output_guardrails=[no_refusals()],
            max_retries=2,  # Retry with feedback
        )

        # Allow partial refusals (e.g., "I cannot verify that, but here's what I know...")
        guarded_agent = GuardedAgent(
            agent,
            output_guardrails=[
                no_refusals(allow_partial_refusals=True)
            ],
        )

        # Custom patterns only
        guarded_agent = GuardedAgent(
            agent,
            output_guardrails=[
                no_refusals(
                    patterns=[r"I don't know", r"No information available"]
                )
            ],
        )
        ```

    Use Cases:
        - **Quality assurance**: Ensure models attempt to answer questions
        - **Auto-retry**: Combine with max_retries for automatic recovery
        - **Production SLAs**: Track and reduce refusal rates
        - **Customer support**: Prevent unhelpful "I cannot help" responses
        - **Fine-tuning evaluation**: Measure model's willingness to assist

    Example with retry:
        ```python
        # Automatically retry refusals with feedback
        guarded_agent = GuardedAgent(
            agent,
            output_guardrails=[no_refusals()],
            max_retries=2,
            on_block='raise',
        )

        # If the model refuses, it will retry with feedback like:
        # "The previous response was a refusal. Please attempt to answer
        #  the question to the best of your ability."
        ```

    Note:
        This guardrail works best with max_retries enabled. When a refusal
        is detected, the retry mechanism sends feedback to the LLM encouraging
        it to attempt an answer.

    Best Practices:
        - Use allow_partial_refusals=True if you want to allow caveated responses
        - Combine with max_retries=2-3 for automatic recovery
        - Monitor refusal metadata to improve prompting
        - Consider custom patterns for domain-specific refusals
