I need to design and implement a production-grade, multi-cloud microservices architecture for a financial services application that must handle 10 million daily transactions with 99.99% uptime. The system must be:

1. **Multi-Cloud**: Primary workload on AWS (us-east-1, us-west-2), disaster recovery on GCP (us-central1), and Azure (eastus) for regulatory compliance in different regions
2. **Compliance**: Must meet PCI-DSS Level 1, HIPAA, SOC2 Type II, and NIST-800-53 requirements simultaneously
3. **Architecture**: Event-driven microservices with 15 services (user-service, payment-service, transaction-service, notification-service, analytics-service, etc.)
4. **Infrastructure Components**:
   - Kubernetes clusters (EKS on AWS, GKE on GCP, AKS on Azure) with auto-scaling
   - Managed databases: RDS PostgreSQL Multi-AZ (primary), Cloud SQL (DR), Azure Database for PostgreSQL (regulatory)
   - Message queues: AWS SQS, GCP Pub/Sub, Azure Service Bus
   - Object storage: S3, GCS, Azure Blob Storage
   - API Gateway with rate limiting and authentication
   - CDN for global content delivery
   - Monitoring and logging infrastructure (CloudWatch, Stackdriver, Azure Monitor)
   - CI/CD pipelines with GitLab CI
5. **Cost Constraints**: Total monthly budget of $50,000 with optimization targets of 30% savings
6. **Security**: End-to-end encryption, VPC isolation, network segmentation, WAF protection
7. **Integration Requirements**: 
   - Connect payment service to RDS with secure networking
   - Integrate analytics service with S3 for data lake
   - Connect notification service to message queues across all clouds
   - Set up monitoring integration across all three cloud providers

Please provide:
- Complete architecture design with visual diagrams
- Terraform code for all three cloud providers
- Compliance analysis for each resource type across all standards
- Detailed cost breakdown for AWS, GCP, and Azure with optimization recommendations
- Integration patterns with security rules and monitoring configurations
- Implementation roadmap with dependency resolution
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- Disaster recovery and backup strategies
