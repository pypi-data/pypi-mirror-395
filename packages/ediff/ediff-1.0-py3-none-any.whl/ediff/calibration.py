Module: ediff.calibration
-------------------------

The calibration of electron diffraction patterns:

* The original diffraction pattern
  shows intensities as a function of *distance-in-pixels*.
* The calibrated diffraction pattern
  shows intensities as a function of *distance-in-q-vectors*.
* The term *distance-in-q-vectors*
  means that the distances = magnitudes of q-vector in [1/A].
* This module gives the *calibration constant*,
  which converts *distance-in-pixels* to *distance-in-q-vectors*.
* The final conversion is very simple:
  `distance_in_q = distance_in_pixels * calibration_constant`

How to determine the `calibration_constant`:
    
* In EDIFF, the calibration constant is calculated in
  ediff.calibration.Calculate
* The calculation is simplified for known microscopes in
  ediff.calibration.Microscopes 
* Links to real-life examples are given at GitHub pages:
  https://mirekslouf.github.io/ediff/docs

        Technical notes
        ---------------
        * ELD profile = 1D radially averaged
          powder electron diffraction pattern
            - in EDIFF, it is obtained from an experimental 2D difractogram
        * XRD profile = 1D powder X-ray diffraction pattern
            - in EDIFF, it is calculated from a standard CIF file
              = Crystallographic Information File
        * EDIFF format of ELD and XRD profiles employed in EDIFF package
            - ELD and XRD profiles can come in the form of files or np.arrays
            - Columns in files <=> rows in np.arrays (we use: *unpack=True*)
            - ELD profile = 3 cols = pixels, intensity, bkgr-corrected-intsty
            - XRD profile = 4 cols = 2theta[deg], S[1/A], q[1/A], norm-intsty

        Parameters
        ----------
        microscope : microscope object, optional, default is None
            One of the microscopes defined in ediff.calibration.Microscopes.
        voltage_kV : int, optional, default is None
            Accelerating voltage in [kV].
            If {None} it is taken from {microscope} argument.
        camera_length_mm : float, optional, default is None
            Camera lenght in [mm].
            If {None} it is taken from {microscope} argument.
            WARNING: this must be the *real_camera_length*;
            see the *Note on camera lenght* section below for more details.
        camera_pixel_size_um : float, optional, default is None
            Camera pixel size in [um].
            If {None} it is taken from {microscope} argument.
        binning : int
            Binning=1,2,4,... increases camera_pixel_size (1x,2x,4x,...).
            If {None} it is taken from {microscope} argument.
        verbose : bool, optional, default is False
            If {True}, the function prints outputs to stdnout.

        Returns
        -------
        calibration constant : float
            The multiplicative constant that converts
            ED-profile X-coordinate-in-pixels
            to X-coordinate-in-q-vectors [1/A].
        
        Technical notes
        ---------------
        * This calculation is based on four microscope parameters,
          namely: (i) accelerating_voltage, (ii) camera_length_mm,
          (iii) camera_pixel_size, and (iv) binning.
        * Nevertheless, three of the parameters may change
          from experiment to experiment:
            - *accelerating_voltage_kV* for given TEM
              can be changed by user (although it is not typical).
            - *camera_length_mm* is routinely adjusted
              to see the desired range of difractions;
              the TEM software usually displays some information
              about the nominal camera length.
            - *binning* averages the neighboring pixels of the camera;
              For example, the binning=1,2,4,...
              increases the pixel size 1x,2x,4x,..
        
        Note on camera length
        ---------------------
        * The *nominal camera length* shown by the microscope (*D*)
          may be different from *real camera length*,
          which is the argument (camera_lenght_um) used in the calculation.
            - Possible reasons: Exact amera position (bottom x upper camera),
              projective lenses (which may change the magnification
              of the diffraction pattern.
            - Real-life solution: we need to know real *camera_length_mm*
              for each theoretical/nominal/TEM-software-displayed
              cammera length *D*!
        * Note: For known/calibrated microscopes
          (that are defined in ediff.calibration.Microscopes)
          we insert the *nominal camera length*, because we know
          the conversion coefficient from nominal to real camera length.
          Here, for the arbitrary microscope, we have to insert
          the *real camera length* in order to get the correct result.
