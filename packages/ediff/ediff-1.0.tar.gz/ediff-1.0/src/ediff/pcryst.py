    '''
    Define crystal structure.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    structure : structure object
        * The *structure object* is usually obtained from a CIF-file
          (CIF = Crystallographic Information File).
        * The *CIF files* are available in crystallographic databases,
          such as http://www.crystallography.net
        * The exact type of the object is *pymatgen.core.structure.Structure*
              * This indicates that the structure is read from CIF by means of
                pymatgen package (which works behind the sceenes).
              * This also means that the structure can be created by any
                other way available in pymatgen https://pymatgen.org/
              * It is also possible to define structure in ediff.io,
                using ediff.io.Lattice and ediff.io.Structure objects.
              * Nevertheless, for common usage it is enough to
                read the structure from CIF, ignoring technical details.
    temp_factors : float or dictionary, optional, the default is 0.8
        * Temperature factors characterize thermal movement of atoms.
        * If a float value is given,
          all elements have this temperature factor value.
        * If a dictionary is given,
          the elements have the values defined in the dictionary;
          a sample input dictionary: `temp_factors = {'Na':1.2, 'Cl':1.1}`.

        * This function (usually) creates an interactive plot.
        * **In CLI** (command line) - the plot is interactive automatically.
        * **In Spyder or Jupyter** - type the following *magic commands*:
            * BEFORE running (switch on the interactive mode): %matplotlib qt
            * AFTER running (back to non-interactive mode): %matplotlib inline
            * In Spyder, the commands are typed in the Console window.
            * In Jupyter, the commands are usually typed in separate cells.
        
        Parameters
        ----------
        output_file: str, optional, default is None
            If the argument is not None, the output is saved to {output_file}.
        two_theta: tuple of two floats, optional, default is None
            If the argument is not None, the plot uses the given two_theta
            range.
            If the argument is None, the plot takes the two_theta_range
            from the (previously defined) ediff.pcryst.Experiment object.
            
        Returns
        -------
        None
            The output is the plot in the screen or in the {output_file}.
            In a typical case, the plot is interactive
            so that the indexed diffractions could be inspected in detail.
        
        Technical note
        --------------
        * This function is usually called as a PXRDcalculation object method.
            - Additional parameters are usually not needed.
            - {output_file} and {theta_range} can modify default plot params.
        * The code below uses (sligthly modified) PyMatGen functions.
            - Reason: PyMatGen plots with diffraction indexes are quite good.
            - Re-programing would be quite difficult, boring, and useless.
