# ⚡️ supplyforge

**supplyforge** is a Python package that implements a reproducible **Snakemake workflow** to generate country-level 
datasets describing the **electricity supply side** for power system analysis and planning.  
It is the companion package to [**demandforge**](https://git.persee.minesparis.psl.eu/energy-alternatives/demandforge), which focuses on demand projection.

---

## 🌍 Overview

The goal of **supplyforge** is to build a consistent and transparent data foundation describing the **generation
infrastructure and resources** of European electricity systems.  

The workflow integrates data obtained primarily from **ENTSO-E** (the European Network of Transmission System Operators
for Electricity), including:

- 🏭 **Installed capacity** by technology (nuclear, gas, hydro, wind, solar, etc.)
- ⚙️ **Availability profiles** by technology and country  
- 💧 **Hydro inflows** and reservoir information  
- 🌦️ **Renewable resource time series** (when available)  
- 📊 **Aggregated country-level summaries** ready for power system modeling tools

---

## 🧩 Features

- Automated **data retrieval** from ENTSO-E public APIs and datasets  
- Harmonized **technology classification** across countries  
- Computation of **availability and inflow time series** for each technology  
- Generation of **validated, ready-to-use datasets** for scenario analysis and planning models  
- Full **traceability and reproducibility** via Snakemake

---

## 🔗 Relation to *demandforge*

| Package | Focus | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| [**demandforge**](https://github.com/yourusername/demandforge) | **Demand** | Creates projected electricity load curves for future scenarios |
| **supplyforge** | **Supply** | Builds datasets describing generation capacity, availability, and inflows |

Together, these tools provide a **complete data pipeline** for future electricity system modeling at the national scale.

---

## ⚙️ Workflow

`supplyforge` uses a modular Snakemake workflow with well-defined stages:

1. **Download** — fetch data from ENTSO-E and other sources  
2. **Preprocess** — clean and align generation technology data  
3. **Compute** — derive availability, inflow, and capacity time series  
4. **Aggregate** — generate standardized outputs for modeling tools

Each rule is designed for transparency, reproducibility, and easy extension to new datasets.

---

## 🧱 Outputs

Typical outputs include:

| Output file | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| `installed_capacity.csv` | Installed capacity by country and technology |
| `availability_profiles.parquet` | Hourly availability by technology |
| `hydro_inflows.parquet` | Hourly inflow series for hydro reservoirs |
| `metadata.yaml` | Documentation of data sources and processing steps |

---

## 📦 Installation

```bash
pip install supplyforge
```

or from source:

```bash
git clone https://git.persee.minesparis.psl.eu/energy-alternatives/supplyforge.git
cd supplyforge
pip install -e .
```

---

## 🚀 Usage

You can run the Snakemake workflow with:

```bash
snakemake --cores all
```

This will download raw data, process it, and generate the final datasets under the `output/` directory.

---

## 📚 Data Sources

- **ENTSO-E Transparency Platform** — generation, availability, and inflows  
- **ENTSO-E Statistical Factsheets** — installed capacities  
- Optional integration with **renewable resource datasets** for solar/wind availability

All datasets are open or publicly accessible, and sources are documented in the workflow metadata.

---

## 🧑‍💻 Contributing

Contributions are welcome!  
You can:
- Add support for additional data sources or countries  
- Improve technology mappings or validation checks  
- Extend workflow outputs for specific modeling frameworks
