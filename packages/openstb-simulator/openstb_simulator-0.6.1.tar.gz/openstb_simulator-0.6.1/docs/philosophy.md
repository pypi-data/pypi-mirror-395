# Philosophy

## Everything should be a plugin

Each user will want to customise simulations to suit their application, the hardware
they are using to run the simulation etc. Making each step within the simulator a plugin
means this customisation involves specifying which plugins to use.


## Plugins should be easy to write


## Plugins should be easy to install and use




## Batteries should be included

Many simulation steps will be common across a wide range of simulations. Plugins
implementing common operations should be included with the simulator.
