"""
Branch Manager Resource for dynamic Nessie branch lifecycle management.

This module provides a Dagster resource for creating, tracking, and cleaning up
dynamic pipeline branches in Nessie. It supports the dynamic branch workflow where
each pipeline run gets its own isolated branch for development and testing.
