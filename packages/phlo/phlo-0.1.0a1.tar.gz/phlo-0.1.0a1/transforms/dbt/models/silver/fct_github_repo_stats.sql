/*
Enriched GitHub repository statistics with calculated metrics

This model adds useful calculated fields:
- Repository metadata and characteristics
- Statistics aggregation and summaries
- Time-based analysis dimensions
- Repository health indicators

These enrichments enable better analytics and visualization in downstream models.
