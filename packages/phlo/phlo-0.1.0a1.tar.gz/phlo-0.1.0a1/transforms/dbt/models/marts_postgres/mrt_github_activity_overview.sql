GitHub activity overview mart for BI dashboards

This mart table is incrementally materialized in Iceberg for fast dashboard queries in
Superset. It provides a denormalized, aggregated view optimized for
visualization and reporting.

Target: Iceberg (incrementally updated), then published to PostgreSQL
Refresh: Every 30 minutes via Dagster schedule, only new data
