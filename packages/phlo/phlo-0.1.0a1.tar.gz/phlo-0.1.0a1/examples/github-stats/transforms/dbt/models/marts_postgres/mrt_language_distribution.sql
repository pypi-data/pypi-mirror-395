/*
Language distribution and engagement metrics

This mart provides language-level statistics showing:
- Repository counts per language
- Engagement metrics (stars, forks) per language
- Activity indicators and age metrics
- Distribution percentages for visualization

Target: PostgreSQL
Use case: Language distribution charts, technology stack analysis in Superset
