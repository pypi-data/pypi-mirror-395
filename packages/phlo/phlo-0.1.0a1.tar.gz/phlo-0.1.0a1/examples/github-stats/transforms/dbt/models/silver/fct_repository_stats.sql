-- fct_repository_stats.sql - Silver layer fact table for enriched repository statistics

/*
Enriched GitHub repository data with calculated metrics

This model adds useful calculated fields:
- Repository age calculations
- Days since last update
- Popularity scoring based on stars, forks, and engagement
- Activity indicators (active in last 30 days)
- Language classification

These enrichments enable better analytics and visualization in downstream models.
