# epsf: Bayesian Effective PSF Modelling

`epsf` is a framework to easily build and model effective PSFs with Python.
It uses PSF models from [`JWST1PASS`](https://www.stsci.edu/~jayander/JWST1PASS/) and the [`simpple`](https://simpple.readthedocs.io) to build PSF models for JWST observations.

Take a look at the documentation for more information: <https://epsf.readthedocs.io>
