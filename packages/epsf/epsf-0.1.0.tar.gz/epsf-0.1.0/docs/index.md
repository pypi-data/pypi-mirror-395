# epsf documentation


`epsf` is a bayesian framework for effective PSF modelling.
It uses PSF models from [`JWST1PASS`](https://www.stsci.edu/~jayander/JWST1PASS/) and the [`simpple`](https://simpple.readthedocs.io) to build PSF models for JWST observations.

```{warning}
This package is a work in progress.
It still needs to be extensively tested in upcoming work.
