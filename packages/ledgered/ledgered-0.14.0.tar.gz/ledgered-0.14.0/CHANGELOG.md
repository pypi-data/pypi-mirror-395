## [0.11.1] - 2025-06-05

### Fixed

## [0.11.0] - 2025-05-15

### Added

- Added two new targets : 'apex_p' and 'apex_m'.

## [0.10.1] - 2025-05-14

### Fixed

- Parsing 'nanos+' in manifests now returns 'nanosp', which is breaking when this name is used to
  gather a SDK tag.
  Added a specific "sdk_name" field in the JSON / `Device` to be returned when parsing the manifest,
  to get back the previous, 0.9.1- behavior.

## [0.10.0] - 2025-05-09

### Added

- Added `devices` module, declaring Ledger devices as class / enum, dynamically generated from a
  JSON configuration file. This should enable to add new devices more easily, and device
  characteristics are now reachable from a centralized place.

## [0.9.1] - 2025-03-26

### Fixed

- Issue with `variant_values` when computed from a Makefile variable

## [0.9.0] - 2025-03-25

### Added

- `ledger-manifest`: new `--token` argument, allowing to provide a PAT to evade GitHub API
  limitations when parsing remote manifest (with the `--url` argument).
- New _property_ to get more info for variants: `variant_param`
- New filtering options:
  - `legacy`: to select or not the Apps whose name contains _legacy_ in their name (disabled by default)
  - `plugin`: to select or not the Apps whose name starts by _app-plugin-_ (disabled by default)
  - `only_list`: to select only a predefined list of Apps
  - `exclude_list`: to exclude a predefined list of Apps
  - `sdk`: to filter apps, based on their SDK (C or Rust)

## [0.8.0] - 2025-03-06

### Added

- `ledger-manifest`: new `--url` argument allows to parse manifest from an application GH repository
  rather than a local file.

### Changed

- Package tested & published on Python3.12 and 3.13. Python 3.8 support is dropped.


## [0.7.1] - 2024-04-30

### Fixed

- Clean error management when there is not `ledger_app.toml` manifest to access to on a given
  repository/branch.


## [0.7.0] - 2024-04-12

### Added

- Added wrapper around GitHub API to ease manipulating Ledger application repositories.


## [0.6.3] - 2024-03-26

- `ledger-binary`: NanoS SDK has a unique `target_version` section.


## [0.6.2] - 2024-03-26

### Fixed

- `ledger-binary`: Striping occasional trailing newlines in metadata content.


## [0.6.1] - 2024-03-26

### Fixed

- `ledger-binary`: Adding Rust application specific metadata sections.

### Changed

- Renamed 'Europa' with official product name 'Flex'


## [0.5.0] - 2024-03-11

### Added

- `ledger-manifest`: "Europa" is now a valid `app.devices` value.

  used from now on.


## [0.4.1] - 2024-02-22

### Fixed

- Fix handling of None value of tests.pytest_directory and tests.unit_directory


## [0.4.0] - 2024-02-22

- `manifest` can now manage `use_cases` and `tests.dependencies`
- outputs can be JSONified

### Changed

- BREAKING: moving the `utils/manifest.py` module into its own `manifest/` subpackage.


## [0.3.0] - 2023-10-30

### Added

- `utils/manifest.py`: RepoManifest now has a `.from_path` method which returns either a `Manifest`
  or a `LegacyManifest`.

### Changed

- `utils/manifest.py`: LegacyManifest now has a `.from_path` method which mimics its initializer
  previous behavior. The initializer signature has changed.


## [0.2.1] - 2023-10-20

- `ledger-manifest`: typo `test` instead of `tests` was leading to runtime AttributeError.


## [0.2.0] - 2023-10-19

  reusability.
