        2. License Grants and Conditions
        --------------------------------
        
        2.1. Grants
        
        Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
        non-exclusive license:
        
        (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
            Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
            modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its

        (b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer
            for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its
            Contributions or its Contributor Version.
        
        2.2. Effective Date
        
        The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution
        become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
        distributes such Contribution.
        
        2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope
        
        The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
        this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
        distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
        Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
        Contributor:
        
        (a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
            or
        
        (b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
            modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
            Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
            Version); or
        
        (c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
            its Contributions.
        
        This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
        or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
        the notice requirements in Section 3.4).
        
        2.4. Subsequent Licenses
        
        No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
        distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
        License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
        permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).
        
        2.5. Representation
        
        Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
        Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
        to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.
        
        2.6. Fair Use
        
        This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
        applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
        equivalents.
        
        2.7. Conditions
        
        Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
        in Section 2.1.
        
        3. Responsibilities
        -------------------
        
        3.1. Distribution of Source Form
        
        All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
        Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
        the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
        Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
        License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
        attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
        Form.
        
        3.2. Distribution of Executable Form
        
        If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:
        
        (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
            Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
            the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
            Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
            than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and
        
        (b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
            License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
            license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
            the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.
        
        3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work
        
        You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
        provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
        the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
        Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
        Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
        License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
        under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
        the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
        Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
        License(s).
        
        3.4. Notices
        
        You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
        (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
        or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
        the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
        the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.
        
        3.5. Application of Additional Terms
        
        You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
        indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
        Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
        behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
        such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
        You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
        liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
        indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
        disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
        jurisdiction.
        
        4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
        ---------------------------------------------------
        
        If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
        License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
        statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
        the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
        describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
        be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
        Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
        or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
        recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
        
        5. Termination
        --------------
        
        5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
        if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
        compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
        Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
        Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
        ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
        non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
        come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
        Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
        notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
        first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
        from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
        Your receipt of the notice.
        
        5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
        infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
        counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
        directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
        You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
        2.1 of this License shall terminate.
        
        5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
        end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
        have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
        prior to termination shall survive termination.

        *  Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a        *
        *  particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the     *
        *  quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.        *

        *  Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as          *
        *  permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect,         *
        *  special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character      *
        *  including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of    *

        8. Litigation
        -------------
        
        Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
        courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal
        place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
        jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.
        Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring
        cross-claims or counter-claims.
        
        9. Miscellaneous
        ----------------
        
        This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
        matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
        unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
        necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
        that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
        shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.
        
        10. Versions of the License
        ---------------------------
        
        10.1. New Versions
        
        Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
        10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
        publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
        distinguishing version number.
        
        10.2. Effect of New Versions
        
        You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version
        of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,
        or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
        steward.
        
        10.3. Modified Versions
        
        If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
        create a new license for such software, you may create and use a
        modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove
        any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that
        such modified license differs from this License).
        
        10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary
        Licenses
        
        If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With
        Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the
        notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.

        If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular
        file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE
        file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to look
        for such a notice.
        
        You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

A Python library for managing Odoo instances through a YAML configuration system. oduit helps start odoo-bin, run tests, and install/update addons with support for multiple environments.

## Features

- **Command Line Interface**: Simple CLI for common Odoo operations (run, install, test, shell)
- **Configuration Management**: YAML/TOML-based configuration with support for multiple environments
- **Process Management**: Run Odoo commands, shell commands, and manage processes
- **Module Management**: Install, update, and test Odoo modules
- **Demo Mode**: Specialized process manager for demo scenarios
- **Code Execution**: Execute Python code within Odoo environments and capture results
- **Flexible Output**: Configurable output formatting and logging
- **Operation Results**: Structured results with success/failure tracking

## Installation

```bash
pip install oduit
```

### Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- PyYAML 5.4+
- tomli 1.2.0+ (Python < 3.11)
- tomli-w 1.0.0+

## Invoking oduit without installing it

```
uvx oduit
```

## Quick Start

### Command Line Interface (CLI)

The easiest way to use oduit is through the command line:

```bash
# Create configuration file at ~/.config/oduit/dev.yaml
cat > ~/.config/oduit/dev.yaml << EOF
binaries:
  python_bin: "/usr/bin/python3"
  odoo_bin: "/path/to/odoo-bin"

odoo_params:
  db_name: "mydb"
  addons_path: "/path/to/addons"
  config_file: "/path/to/odoo.conf"
EOF

# Run Odoo server
oduit --env dev run

# Install a module
oduit --env dev install sale

# Run tests
oduit --env dev test --test-tags /sale

# Start Odoo shell
oduit --env dev shell

# Update a module
oduit --env dev update sale

# Create a new addon
oduit --env dev create-addon my_custom_module

# Export translations
oduit --env dev export-lang sale --language de_DE

# List available addons
oduit --env dev list-addons

# List addons with filters
oduit --env dev list-addons --exclude category:Theme
oduit --env dev list-addons --include author:Odoo --exclude-core-addons

# Print addon manifest information
oduit --env dev print-manifest sale

# List unique values for a manifest field
oduit --env dev list-manifest-values category
oduit --env dev list-manifest-values license --exclude-core-addons
```

**Local Project Configuration:**

Create a `.oduit.toml` in your project directory to avoid specifying `--env`:

```toml
[binaries]
python_bin = "./venv/bin/python"
odoo_bin = "./odoo/odoo-bin"

[odoo_params]
addons_path = "./addons"
db_name = "project_dev"
dev = true
```

Then run commands without `--env`:

```bash
oduit run
oduit install sale
oduit test --test-tags /sale
```

### Python API

For programmatic access and advanced usage, use the Python API:

#### Enhanced Operation Execution

```python
from oduit.config_loader import ConfigLoader
from oduit.process_manager import ProcessManager
from oduit.builders import InstallCommandBuilder, OdooTestCommandBuilder

# Load configuration
config_loader = ConfigLoader()
config = config_loader.load_config("myenv")

# Initialize process manager
process_manager = ProcessManager()

# Install a module using structured operations
install_builder = InstallCommandBuilder(config, "sale")
install_operation = install_builder.build_operation()

result = process_manager.run_operation(install_operation, verbose=True)

if result['success']:
    print("Module installed successfully!")
    print(f"Modules installed: {result.get('modules_installed', [])}")
    if result.get('modules_loaded'):
        print(f"Modules loaded: {result['modules_loaded']}")
else:
    print(f"Installation failed: {result.get('error', 'Unknown error')}")
    if result.get('dependency_errors'):
        print("Dependency errors:")
        for error in result['dependency_errors']:
            print(f"  - {error}")

# Run tests with enhanced result parsing
test_builder = OdooTestCommandBuilder(config, "/sale")
test_operation = test_builder.build_operation()

result = process_manager.run_operation(test_operation)

print(f"Test Success: {result['success']}")
print(f"Total Tests: {result.get('total_tests', 0)}")
print(f"Passed: {result.get('passed_tests', 0)}")
print(f"Failed: {result.get('failed_tests', 0)}")

if result.get('failures'):
    print("Test Failures:")
    for failure in result['failures']:
        print(f"  {failure['test_name']}: {failure.get('error_message', 'No details')}")
```

## Core Components

### Command Builders (New Architecture)

Build structured operations with rich metadata for enhanced result processing:

```python
from oduit.builders import (
    InstallCommandBuilder,
    UpdateCommandBuilder,
    OdooTestCommandBuilder,
    ShellCommandBuilder,
    DatabaseCommandBuilder
)

# Install command with metadata
install_builder = InstallCommandBuilder(config, "sale")
operation = install_builder.build_operation()

print(f"Command: {' '.join(operation.command)}")
print(f"Operation Type: {operation.operation_type}")  # 'install'
print(f"Modules: {operation.modules}")                # ['sale']
print(f"Result Parsers: {operation.result_parsers}")  # ['install']

# Test command with coverage
test_builder = OdooTestCommandBuilder(config, "/my_module")
operation = test_builder.build_operation()

print(f"Test Tags: {operation.test_tags}")            # '/my_module'
print(f"Expected Results: {operation.expected_result_fields}")

# Database operations
db_builder = DatabaseCommandBuilder(config)
db_builder.create_database("new_db")
operation = db_builder.build_operation()

print(f"Is Odoo Command: {operation.is_odoo_command}")  # False (postgres command)
```

### ConfigLoader

Loads and manages configuration from YAML/TOML files:

```python
from oduit import ConfigLoader

loader = ConfigLoader()

# Load environment configuration
config = loader.load_config("production")

# Check available environments
environments = loader.get_available_environments()

# Load local project configuration
if loader.has_local_config():
    local_config = loader.load_local_config()
```

### ConfigProvider

Provides a clean interface for accessing configuration values:

```python
from oduit.config_provider import ConfigProvider

provider = ConfigProvider(config)

# Get required values
db_name = provider.get_required("db_name")

# Get optional values with defaults
port = provider.get_optional("http_port", 8069)

# Get Odoo parameters as command line list
params = provider.get_odoo_params_list()
# Returns: ["--db-name=mydb", "--addons-path=/path/to/addons", "--http-port=8069"]
```

### ProcessManager

Execute commands with enhanced structured operations:

```python
from oduit.process_manager import ProcessManager
from oduit.builders import (
    InstallCommandBuilder,
    UpdateCommandBuilder,
    OdooTestCommandBuilder,
    ShellCommandBuilder
)

pm = ProcessManager()

# Enhanced structured operations (recommended)
install_builder = InstallCommandBuilder(config, "purchase")
operation = install_builder.build_operation()
result = pm.run_operation(operation, verbose=True)

# Access structured results
print(f"Success: {result['success']}")
print(f"Operation Type: {result.get('operation_type')}")
print(f"Database: {result.get('database')}")
print(f"Modules Installed: {result.get('modules_installed', [])}")

# Test operations with detailed parsing
test_builder = OdooTestCommandBuilder(config, "/my_module")
test_operation = test_builder.build_operation()
result = pm.run_operation(test_operation)

if result.get('failures'):
    print("Test failures:")
    for failure in result['failures']:
        print(f"  {failure['test_name']}: {failure.get('error_message')}")

# Update operations
update_builder = UpdateCommandBuilder(config, "stock")
update_operation = update_builder.build_operation()
result = pm.run_operation(update_operation)

print(f"Modules Updated: {result.get('modules_updated', [])}")

# Run Odoo commands directly
result = pm.run_command([
    "odoo-bin", "--db-name", "mydb", "--stop-after-init"
], timeout=30000)

# Real-time output streaming
for item in pm.run_command_yielding(["odoo-bin", "--help"]):
    if 'line' in item:
        print(item['line'].strip())
```

#### Process Manager Types

Choose the right process manager for your use case:

```python
from oduit.process_manager import ProcessManager
from oduit.demo_process_manager import DemoProcessManager

# Default: SystemProcessManager (subprocess execution)
pm = ProcessManager()

# Demo: Simulated execution for testing
pm = DemoProcessManager(config, available_modules=["base", "sale"])
```

**When to use each:**

- **SystemProcessManager**: Shell scripting, piped commands, external tools
- **DemoProcessManager**: Testing, demonstrations, offline development

**Shell Command Examples:**

```python
# System manager: Full shell support
result = pm.run_shell_command('echo "data" | psql mydb', capture_output=True)
```

### ModuleManager

Manage Odoo modules:

```python
from oduit import ModuleManager

mm = ModuleManager(config)

# Install modules
result = mm.install_module("sale", "mydb")

# Update modules
result = mm.update_module("stock", "mydb")

# Run module tests
result = mm.test_module("account", "mydb")

# Bulk operations
result = mm.install_modules(["sale", "purchase", "stock"], "mydb")
```

### OdooCodeExecutor

Execute Python code within an Odoo environment and capture results directly as Python objects:

```python
from oduit.config_provider import ConfigProvider
from oduit.odoo_code_executor import OdooCodeExecutor

# Initialize with configuration
basic_config = {
    "db_name": "mydb",
    "db_user": "odoo",
    "db_password": "odoo",
    "addons_path": "/opt/odoo/addons",
    "data_dir": "~/data",
}
config_provider = ConfigProvider(basic_config)
executor = OdooCodeExecutor(config_provider)

# Execute simple expressions - get partner name
result = executor.execute_code("env['res.partner'].search([],limit=1).name")
if result["success"]:
    partner_name = result["value"]  # Returns actual string, not printed output
    print(f"Partner: {partner_name}")

# Execute multi-line code with return values
code = """
partner_count = len(env['res.partner'].search([]))
customer_count = len(env['res.partner'].search([('is_company', '=', False)]))
company_count = len(env['res.partner'].search([('is_company', '=', True)]))

{
    'total_partners': partner_count,
    'customers': customer_count,
    'companies': company_count,
    'ratio': f"{customer_count}/{company_count}" if company_count > 0 else "N/A"
}
"""
result = executor.execute_code(code)
if result["success"]:
    stats = result["value"]  # Returns the dictionary directly
    print(f"Total partners: {stats['total_partners']}")
    print(f"Customer/Company ratio: {stats['ratio']}")

# Create data (with transaction control)
create_code = """
partner = env['res.partner'].create({
    'name': 'Test Partner',
    'email': 'test@example.com',
    'is_company': False
})
{'id': partner.id, 'name': partner.name, 'email': partner.email}
"""
result = executor.execute_code(create_code, commit=True)  # Will commit changes
if result["success"]:
    partner_data = result["value"]
    print(f"Created partner: {partner_data}")

# Execute multiple code blocks in sequence
code_blocks = [
    "partners = env['res.partner'].search([('is_company', '=', True)], limit=3)",
    "partner_names = [p.name for p in partners]",
    "{'count': len(partner_names), 'names': partner_names}"
]
result = executor.execute_multiple(code_blocks)
if result["success"]:
    final_result = result["results"][-1]["value"]
    print(f"Found {final_result['count']} companies: {final_result['names']}")

# Error handling
result = executor.execute_code("nonexistent_variable + 42")
if not result["success"]:
    print(f"Error: {result['error']}")
    print(f"Traceback: {result['traceback']}")
```

**Key Features:**

- **Direct Result Capture**: Returns Python objects, not console output
- **Expression & Statement Support**: Handles both single expressions and multi-line code blocks
- **Transaction Control**: Rollback by default, optional commit
- **Error Handling**: Detailed error messages and tracebacks
- **Multiple Code Blocks**: Execute sequences of related code in same transaction
- **Odoo Environment**: Full access to `env`, `cr`, `uid`, and common Python modules

### Manifest

Parse and validate Odoo module manifests:

```python
from oduit import Manifest

# Load manifest from __manifest__.py
manifest = Manifest.from_path("/path/to/module")

print(f"Module: {manifest.name}")
print(f"Version: {manifest.version}")
print(f"Dependencies: {manifest.depends}")

# Validate manifest
try:
    manifest.validate()
    print("Manifest is valid!")
except ManifestError as e:
    print(f"Invalid manifest: {e}")
```

## Configuration Formats

### Environment Configuration

**YAML Format** (`~/.config/oduit/myenv.yaml`):

```yaml
binaries:
  python_bin: "/usr/bin/python3"
  odoo_bin: "/opt/odoo/odoo-bin"

odoo_params:
  db_name: "mydb"
  addons_path: "/opt/odoo/addons:/custom/addons"
  config_file: "/etc/odoo/odoo.conf"
  workers: 4
  dev: true
```

**TOML Format** (`~/.config/oduit/myenv.toml`):

```toml
[binaries]
python_bin = "/usr/bin/python3"
odoo_bin = "/opt/odoo/odoo-bin"

[odoo_params]
db_name = "mydb"
addons_path = "/opt/odoo/addons:/custom/addons"
config_file = "/etc/odoo/odoo.conf"
workers = 4
dev = true
```

### Local Project Configuration

Create `.oduit.toml` in your project root for project-specific settings:

```toml
[binaries]
python_bin = "./venv/bin/python"
odoo_bin = "./odoo/odoo-bin"

[odoo_params]
addons_path = "./addons"
db_name = "project_dev"
dev = true
```

## Exception Handling

oduit provides specific exceptions for different error scenarios:

```python
from oduit import (
    ConfigError,
    OdooOperationError,
    ModuleOperationError,
    ModuleNotFoundError,
    DatabaseOperationError
)

try:
    result = module_manager.install_module("nonexistent", "mydb")
except ModuleNotFoundError as e:
    print(f"Module not found: {e}")
except DatabaseOperationError as e:
    print(f"Database error: {e}")
except OdooOperationError as e:
    print(f"Odoo operation failed: {e}")
```

## Output and Logging

Configure output formatting:

```python
from oduit import configure_output, print_info, print_success, print_error

# Configure output (colors, verbose mode, etc.)
configure_output(verbose=True, no_color=False)

# Use formatted output
print_info("Starting Odoo installation...")
print_success("Module installed successfully!")
print_error("Failed to connect to database")
```

## Examples

The `examples/` directory contains comprehensive examples showing both legacy and enhanced usage patterns:

### Enhanced Architecture Examples

- `enhanced_demo_example.py` - Complete workflow using command builders and structured operations
- `demo_comparison.py` - Side-by-side comparison of legacy vs enhanced approaches
- `code_executor_example.py` - Execute Python code within Odoo environments and capture results

### Legacy Examples (Still Supported)

- `simple_shell_example.py` - Basic shell command usage
- `install_module_example.py` - Module installation
- `test_module_example.py` - Module testing
- `demo_mode_example.py` - Demo process management
- `module_manifest_example.py` - Manifest parsing

### Key Enhanced Features Demonstrated

**Structured Results with Automatic Parsing:**

```python
# From enhanced_demo_example.py
result = process_manager.run_operation(install_operation)

# Rich structured results automatically parsed
print(f"Modules Loaded: {result.get('modules_loaded', 0)}")
print(f"Dependency Errors: {result.get('dependency_errors', [])}")
print(f"Installation Duration: {result.get('duration', 0):.2f}s")
```

**Test Results with Failure Details:**

```python
# Detailed test failure information
if result.get('failures'):
    for failure in result['failures']:
        print(f"Failed Test: {failure['test_name']}")
        print(f"File: {failure.get('file', 'Unknown')}:{failure.get('line', '?')}")
        print(f"Error: {failure.get('error_message', 'No details')}")
```

**Semantic Success Detection:**

```python
# Operations can be marked as failed even if process exits with code 0
# when semantic analysis detects issues (e.g., unmet dependencies)
if not result['success'] and result.get('dependency_errors'):
    print("Installation failed due to dependency issues:")
    for error in result['dependency_errors']:
        print(f"  - {error}")
```
