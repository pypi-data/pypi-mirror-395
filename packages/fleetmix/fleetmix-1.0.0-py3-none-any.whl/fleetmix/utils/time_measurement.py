Time Measurement Module

This module measures time metrics for code blocks, including wall-clock and CPU times
for the process and its children.

Usage:
    recorder = TimeRecorder()
    with recorder.measure("my_span"):
        # Code block here
    print(recorder.measurements)

TimeMeasurement contains:
    - span_name: str, identifier for the code block
    - wall_time: float, elapsed real time in seconds
    - process_user_time: float, user CPU time of the process
    - process_system_time: float, system CPU time of the process
    - children_user_time: float, user CPU time of child processes
    - children_system_time: float, system CPU time of child processes
