merge_phase.py

Implements the **improvement phase** (Section 4.4 of the paper) that iteratively tries to merge
small, neighbouring clusters after the core FSM model has been solved.

Rationale
~~~~~~~~~
The MILP in ``fleetmix.optimization.optimize_fleet`` chooses from a *fixed* pool of clusters.  Once an
initial solution is available, additional cost savings can sometimes be obtained by *merging* two
clusters and serving the combined demand with a larger vehicle—provided capacity and route‐time
constraints remain feasible.

Algorithm outline
-----------------
1. Identify "small" clusters (≤ ``params.small_cluster_size`` customers).
2. For each small cluster *s* find the nearest candidate cluster *t* that is:
   • compatible in product mix,
   • within capacity, and
   • likely feasible on route‐time (quick lower bound check).
3. Evaluate the merged cluster precisely using :func:`utils.route_time.estimate_route_time` to
   verify that the merged cluster's estimated route time does not exceed the vehicle's maximum route time.
4. Collect all feasible merges, append them to the cluster pool, and re‐optimise the MILP **without
   triggering a recursive improvement**.
5. Repeat until no further cost reduction is achieved or the iteration cap
   ``params.max_improvement_iterations`` is reached.

Caching & performance
---------------------
Route‐time calculations for the same customer sets are memoised in the module‐level dict
``_merged_route_time_cache``.

Outcome
-------
Returns the *best* improved solution dictionary, identical in structure to the one produced by
``fleetmix.optimization.optimize_fleet`` but with potentially lower total cost.

    """Iteratively merge small clusters to lower total cost.

    Implements the *improvement phase* described in Section 4.4.  Starting from
    an existing solution dictionary, the algorithm searches for pairs of
    "small" clusters that can be feasibly served together by the same vehicle
    configuration and whose merge reduces the overall objective value.

    Args:
        initial_solution: Solution object returned by
            :func:`fleetmix.optimization.optimize_fleet`.
        configurations: List of vehicle configurations, each containing
            capacity, fixed cost, and compartment information.
        customers: List of CustomerBase objects; required for route-time
            recalculation and centroid updates when evaluating merges.
        params: Parameter object controlling thresholds such as
            ``small_cluster_size``, ``max_improvement_iterations``, etc.

    Returns:
        FleetmixSolution: Improved solution object (same schema as *initial_solution*).
        If no improving merge is found the original object is returned.

    Example:
        >>> improved = improve_solution(sol, configs, customers, params)
        >>> improved.total_cost <= sol.total_cost
