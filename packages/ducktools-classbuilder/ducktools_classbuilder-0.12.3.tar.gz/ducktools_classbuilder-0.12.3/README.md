# Ducktools: Class Builder #

`ducktools-classbuilder` is both an alternate implementation of the dataclasses concept
along with a toolkit for creating your own customised implementation.

Available from PyPI as [ducktools-classbuilder](https://pypi.org/project/ducktools-classbuilder/).

Installation[^1]:
  * With [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
    * `uv add ducktools-classbuilder` to add to an existing project
    * `uv add ducktools-classbuilder --script scriptname.py` to add to
      [script dependencies](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/inline-script-metadata/#inline-script-metadata)
    * `uv run --with ducktools-classbuilder python` to try in the Python repl
  * With [poetry](https://python-poetry.org)
    * `poetry add ducktools-classbuilder` to add to an existing project

Create classes using type annotations:

```python
from ducktools.classbuilder.prefab import prefab

@prefab
class Book:
    title: str = "The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy"
    author: str = "Douglas Adams"
    year: int = 1979
```

Using `attribute()` calls (this may look familiar to `attrs` users before Python added
type annotations)

```python
from ducktools.classbuilder.prefab import attribute, prefab

@prefab
class Book:
    title = attribute(default="The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy")
    author = attribute(default="Douglas Adams")
    year = attribute(default=1979)
```

Or using a special mapping for slots:

```python
from ducktools.classbuilder.prefab import SlotFields, prefab

@prefab
class Book:
    __slots__ = SlotFields(
        title="The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy",
        author="Douglas Adams",
        year=1979,
    )
```

As with `dataclasses` or `attrs`, `ducktools-classbuilder` will handle writing the
boilerplate `__init__`, `__eq__` and `__repr__` functions for you.

Unlike `dataclasses` or `attrs`, `ducktools-classbuilder` generates and executes its
templated functions lazily, so they are only executed if and when the methods are first
used. This significantly reduces the time taken to create the classes as unused methods
are never generated. Before generation occurs, the descriptors can be seen in the class
`__dict__`, after first use these are replaced.

```python
>>> Book.__dict__["__init__"]
<MethodMaker for '__init__' method>
>>> Book()
Book(title='The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy', author='Douglas Adams', year=1979)
>>> Book.__dict__["__init__"]
<function Book.__init__ at ...>
```

The gathering of field and class information is also separated from the build step
so it is possible to change how this information is gathered without needing to rewrite
the code generation tools.

## The base class `Prefab` implementation ##

Alongside the `@prefab` decorator there is also a `Prefab` base class that can be used.

The main differences in behaviour are that `Prefab` will generate `__slots__` by default
using a metaclass, and any options given to `Prefab` will automatically be set on subclasses.

Unlike attrs' `@define` or dataclasses' `@dataclass`, `@prefab` does not and will not support
`__slots__` (this is explained in a section below).

```python
from pathlib import Path
from ducktools.classbuilder.prefab import Prefab, attribute

class Slotted(Prefab):
    the_answer: int = 42
    the_question: str = attribute(
        default="What do you get if you multiply six by nine?",
        doc="Life the universe and everything",
    )
    python_path: Path("/usr/bin/python4")

ex = Slotted()
print(ex)
```

The generated code for the methods can be viewed using the `print_generated_code` helper function.

### Core ###

The main `ducktools.classbuilder` module provides tools for creating a customized version of the `dataclass` concept.

* `MethodMaker`
  * This tool takes a function that generates source code and converts it into a descriptor
    that will execute the source code and attach the gemerated method to a class on demand.
  * This is what you use if you need to write a customized `__init__` method or add some other
    generated method.
* `Field`
  * This defines a basic dataclass-like field with some basic arguments
  * This class itself is a dataclass-like of sorts
    (unfortunately it does not play well with `@dataclass_transform` and hence, typing)
  * Additional arguments can be added by subclassing and using annotations
    * See `ducktools.classbuilder.prefab.Attribute` for an example of this
* Gatherers
  * These collect field information and return both the gathered fields and any modifications
    that will need to be made to the class when built to support them.
  * This is what you would use if, for instance you wanted to use `Annotated[...]` to define
    how fields should act instead of arguments. The full documentation includes an example
    implementing this for a simple dataclass-like.
* `builder`
  * This is the main tool used for constructing decorators and base classes to provide
    generated methods.
  * Other than the required changes to a class for `__slots__` that are done by `SlotMakerMeta`
    this is where all class mutations should be applied.
  * Once you have a gatherer and a set of `MethodMaker`s run this to add the methods to the class
* `SlotMakerMeta`
  * When given a gatherer, this metaclass will create `__slots__` automatically.

### Prefab ###

The prebuilt 'prefab' implementation includes additional customization including
`__prefab_pre_init__` and `__prefab_post_init__` methods.

Both of these methods will take any field names as arguments. Those passed to `__prefab_pre_init__` will still be set
inside the main `__init__` body, while those passed to `__prefab_post_init__` will not.

`__prefab_pre_init__` is intended as a place to perform validation checks before values are set in the main body.
`__prefab_post_init__` can be seen as a partial `__init__` function, where you only need to write
the `__init__` function for arguments that need more than basic assignment.

Here is an example using `__prefab_post_init__` that converts a string or Path object into a path object:

```python
from pathlib import Path
from ducktools.classbuilder.prefab import Prefab

class AppDetails(Prefab, frozen=True):
    app_name: str
    app_path: Path

    def __prefab_post_init__(self, app_path: str | Path):
        # frozen in `Prefab` is implemented as a 'set-once' __setattr__ function.
        # So we do not need to use `object.__setattr__` here
        self.app_path = Path(app_path)

steam = AppDetails(
    "Steam",
    r"C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steam.exe"
)

print(steam)
```

<details>

<summary>The generated code for the init method</summary>

```python
def __init__(self, app_name, app_path):
    self.app_name = app_name
    self.__prefab_post_init__(app_path=app_path)
```

Note: annotations are attached as `__annotations__` and so do not appear in generated
source code.

</details>

#### Features and Differences ####

`Prefab` and `@prefab` support many standard dataclass features along with
some extra features and some intentional differences in design.

* All standard methods are generated on-demand
  * This makes the construction of classes much faster in general
  * Generation is done and then cached on first access using non-data descriptors
* Standard `__init__`, `__eq__` and `__repr__` methods are generated by default
  - The `__repr__` implementation does not automatically protect against recursion,
    but there is a `recursive_repr` argument that will do so if needed
* `repr`, `eq` and `kw_only` arguments work as they do in `dataclasses`
* There is an optional `iter` argument that will make the class iterable
* `__prefab_post_init__` will take any field name as an argument and can
  be used to write a 'partial' `__init__` function for only non-standard attributes
* The `frozen` argument will make the dataclass a 'write once' object
  * This is to make the partial `__prefab_post_init__` function more natural
    to write for frozen classes
* `dict_method=True` will generate an `as_dict` method that gives a dictionary of
  attributes that have `serialize=True` (the default)
* `ignore_annotations` can be used to only use the presence of `attribute` values
  to decide how the class is constructed
  * This is intended for cases where evaluating the annotations may trigger imports
    which could be slow and unnecessary for the function of class generation
* `replace=False` can be used to avoid defining the `__replace__` method
* `attribute` has additional options over dataclasses' `Field`
  * `iter=True` will include the attribute in the iterable if `__iter__` is generated
  * `serialize=True` decides if the attribute is include in `as_dict`
  * `exclude_field` is short for `repr=False`, `compare=False`, `iter=False`, `serialize=False`
  * `private` is short for `exclude_field=True` and `init=False` and requires a default or factory
  * `doc` will add this string as the value in slotted classes, which appears in `help()`
* `build_prefab` can be used to dynamically create classes and *does* support a slots argument
  * Unlike dataclasses, this does not create the class twice in order to provide slots

There are also some intentionally missing features:

* The `@prefab` decorator does not and will never support a `slots` argument
  * Use `Prefab` for slots.
* `as_dict` and the generated `.as_dict` method **do not** recurse or deep copy
* `unsafe_hash` is not provided
* `weakref_slot` is not available as an argument
  * `__weakref__` can be added to slots by declaring it as if it were an attribute
* There is no safety check for mutable defaults
  * You should still use `default_factory` as you would for dataclasses, not doing so
    is still incorrect
  * `dataclasses` uses hashability as a proxy for mutability, but technically this is
    inaccurate as you can be unhashable but immutable and mutable but hashable
  * This may change in a future version, but I haven't felt the need to add this check so far
* In Python 3.14 Annotations are gathered as `VALUE` if possible and `STRING` if this fails
  * `VALUE` annotations are used as they are faster in most cases
  * As the `__init__` method gets `__annotations__` these need to be either values or strings
    to match the behaviour of previous Python versions
* There is currently no equivalent to `InitVar`
  * I'm not sure *how* I would want to implement this other than I don't _really_ want to use
    annotations to decide behaviour (this is messy enough with `ClassVar` and `KW_ONLY`).

## What is the issue with generating `__slots__` with a decorator ##

If you want to use `__slots__` in order to save memory you have to declare
them when the class is originally created as you can't add them later.

When you use `@dataclass(slots=True)`[^2] with `dataclasses`, the function
has to make a new class and attempt to copy over everything from the original.

This is because decorators operate on classes *after they have been created*
while slots need to be declared beforehand.
While you can change the value of `__slots__` after a class has been created,
this will have no effect on the internal structure of the class.

By using a metaclass or by declaring fields using `__slots__` however,
the fields can be set *before* the class is constructed, so the class
will work correctly without needing to be rebuilt.

For example these two classes would be roughly equivalent, except that
`@dataclass` has had to recreate the class from scratch while `Prefab`
has created `__slots__` and added the methods on to the original class.
This means that any references stored to the original class *before*
`@dataclass` has rebuilt the class will not be pointing towards the
correct class.

Here's a demonstration of the issue using a registry for serialization
functions.

> This example requires Python 3.10 or later as earlier versions of
> `dataclasses` did not support the `slots` argument.

```python
import json
from dataclasses import dataclass
from ducktools.classbuilder.prefab import Prefab, attribute


class _RegisterDescriptor:
    def __init__(self, func, registry):
        self.func = func
        self.registry = registry

    def __set_name__(self, owner, name):
        self.registry.register(owner, self.func)
        setattr(owner, name, self.func)


class SerializeRegister:
    def __init__(self):
        self.serializers = {}

    def register(self, cls, func):
        self.serializers[cls] = func

    def register_method(self, method):
        return _RegisterDescriptor(method, self)

    def default(self, o):
        try:
            return self.serializers[type(o)](o)
        except KeyError:
            raise TypeError(f"Object of type {type(o).__name__} is not JSON serializable")


register = SerializeRegister()


@dataclass(slots=True)
class DataCoords:
    x: float = 0.0
    y: float = 0.0

    @register.register_method
    def to_json(self):
        return {"x": self.x, "y": self.y}


# slots=True is the default for Prefab
class BuilderCoords(Prefab):
    x: float = 0.0
    y: float = attribute(default=0.0, doc="y coordinate")

    @register.register_method
    def to_json(self):
        return {"x": self.x, "y": self.y}


# In both cases __slots__ have been defined
print(f"{DataCoords.__slots__ = }")
print(f"{BuilderCoords.__slots__ = }\n")

data_ex = DataCoords()
builder_ex = BuilderCoords()

objs = [data_ex, builder_ex]

print(data_ex)
print(builder_ex)
print()

# Demonstrate you can not set values not defined in slots
for obj in objs:
    try:
        obj.z = 1.0
    except AttributeError as e:
        print(e)
print()

print("Attempt to serialize:")
for obj in objs:
    try:
        print(f"{type(obj).__name__}: {json.dumps(obj, default=register.default)}")
    except TypeError as e:
        print(f"{type(obj).__name__}: {e!r}")
```

Output (Python 3.12):
```
DataCoords.__slots__ = ('x', 'y')
BuilderCoords.__slots__ = {'x': None, 'y': 'y coordinate'}

DataCoords(x=0.0, y=0.0)
BuilderCoords(x=0.0, y=0.0)

'DataCoords' object has no attribute 'z'
'BuilderCoords' object has no attribute 'z'

Attempt to serialize:
DataCoords: TypeError('Object of type DataCoords is not JSON serializable')
BuilderCoords: {"x": 0.0, "y": 0.0}
```

## Will you add \<feature\> to `classbuilder.prefab`? ##

No. Not unless it's something I need or find interesting.

The original version of `prefab_classes` was intended to have every feature
anybody could possibly require, but this is no longer the case with this
rebuilt version.

I will fix bugs (assuming they're not actually intended behaviour).

However the whole goal of this module is if you want to have a class generator
with a specific feature, you can create or add it yourself.
