### Configure Plugins
Plugins extend the core functionality of pyonir and add new features, modify existing behavior, or integrate with third-party services.

To install a plugin, use the pyonir CLI tool.

**Install plugins from the pyonir plugins registry on github**

```bash
> pyonir install plugin:<repo_owner>/<repo_name>#<repo_branch>
```

**Install themes from the pyonir theme registry on github**

```bash
> pyonir install theme:<repo_owner>/<repo_name>#<repo_branch>
```
