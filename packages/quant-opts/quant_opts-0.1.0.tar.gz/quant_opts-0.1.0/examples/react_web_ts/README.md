# React / TypeScript demo

This demo expects bundler-friendly bindings generated by wasm-pack.

1) Generate bindings:

```bash
make wasm-bindings
```

This creates `target/wasm/pkg-react/` with `quant_opts.js`/`quant_opts_bg.wasm` and a `package.json` (plus `web/` with the web build for non-bundler use).

2) Install JS deps and run dev server:

```bash
cd examples/react_web_ts
npm install
npm run dev
# open the URL shown by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173)
```

In code (see `src/App.tsx`), we import from `quant-opts` (declared as a file dependency to `../../target/wasm/pkg-react`) and call `price_call_bs` after `init()` resolves.
