# Vanilla web JS demo

Build wasm bindings (via Makefile target):

```bash
make wasm-bindings
```

Serve locally (from this directory):

```bash
cd examples/vanilla_web_js
python -m http.server 8989
# open http://localhost:8989
```

The page imports `../../target/wasm/pkg-web/wasm_api.js` generated by wasm-pack and computes a call price.
