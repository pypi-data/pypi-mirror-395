        shutdown()
            Shut down the driver and release resources.

        cleanup()
            Clean up the driver state.

        get_driver_state() -> DriverState
            Get the current state of the driver.

        get_driver_version_string() -> str
            Get the version string of the underlying driver.

        read_frame() -> BotaFrame
            Read a single data frame (non-blocking).

        read_frame_blocking() -> BotaFrame
            Read a single data frame (blocking until available).
