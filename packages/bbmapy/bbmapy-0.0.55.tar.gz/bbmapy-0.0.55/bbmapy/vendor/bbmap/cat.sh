Description:  Concatenates and recompresses text files.
Compressed files (gz and bz2) are decompressed first.
Do not use with binary files, it replaces \r\n with \n.

Usage:  cat.sh *.fna out=catted.fa.gz

Standard parameters:
in=<file>       Comma-delimited input.  Filenames with no 'in=' will
                also be treated as input files.
out=<file>      Output.  Defaults to stdout.
ziplevel=2      (zl) Set to 1 (lowest) through 9 (max) to change compression
                level; lower compression is faster.

Processing parameters:
None yet!

Java Parameters:
-Xmx            This will set Java's memory usage, overriding autodetection.
                -Xmx20g will specify 20 gigs of RAM, and -Xmx200m will
                specify 200 megs. The max is typically 85% of physical memory.
-eoom           This flag will cause the process to exit if an out-of-memory
                exception occurs.  Requires Java 8u92+.
-da             Disable assertions.
