======================
Installation Procedure
======================

The Quantum Rings SDK now supports Nvidia GPUs in both native mode and with the Qiskit toolkit. The following steps outline the installation procedure.


**STEP - 1**

To obtain your license for the `Quantum Rings SDK <https://www.quantumrings.com/>`_,  register by selecting the **Login** option from the menu.

If you are already registered, you can skip this step.

Next, log in to the `Quantum Rings portal <https://portal.quantumrings.com/developer/>`_. 
To download your access keys, select the **Manage Keys** option in the left sidebar.


**STEP - 2**

.. note::
    
    If you are using a university supercomputer or a cloud instance with NVIDIA GPUs, your system administrator may have already installed the necessary 
    NVIDIA drivers for you. In such cases, you can skip this step.

.. warning::

    This step may be challenging, and you may need professional help. Installing device drivers can make your installation unstable. Always proceed with a backup and read all
    documentation carefully. Ensure you install the correct drivers for your hardware platform. Installing open source drivers may not be a good idea.

Update the `NVIDIA drivers <https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/>`_ for your system.
For some Linux distributions, you may need to install the NVIDIA drivers directly from the distribution. Please search for the documentation
from your Linux operating system provider and follow their recommendation.

If you are installing on WSL-based Linux, you must update the NVIDIA driver in Windows. It will automatically apply to the WSL Linux instance.

Note down the driver version by running the ``nvidia-smi`` command in the terminal and observing the version displayed in the top panel. 
You will need to know the driver version to install the CUDA Toolkit later.


**STEP - 3**

Create a virtual environment for your Python version using the following example.

.. code-block:: console

    virtualenv --python=/usr/bin/python3.11 myenv311
    source myenv31/bin/activate

In some installations, the virtual environment can be created as follows:

.. code-block:: console

    python3.11 -m venv myenv311
    source myenv311/bin/activate

Note that installing a Python virtual environment may require additional steps.

You can optionally install Jupyter Notebook using the following command.

.. code-block:: console

    pip install notebook


**STEP - 4**

Choose the appropriate CUDA Toolkit (CTK) for your driver version. Section 2.2 CUDA Driver in `Release notes <https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-toolkit-release-notes/index.html>`_ outlines the CUDA Driver version 
range and the CUDA Toolkit (CTK) you could install.
Install the CUDA Toolkit (CTK) by following the instructions in the link: `CUDA Toolkit <https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit>`_
Follow the instructions on the screen after installing and setting up the CUDA Toolkit, and set the paths as directed.


.. note::

	Linux Users:

	After installing the CUDA Toolkit, you may have to set the environment variable ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` to point to the folder where the CUDA Toolkit library was installed.
	If this is not set, then there may be runtime linkage errors when you import QuantumRingsLib in your Python code.

    Assuming ``/usr/local/cuda-13.0`` is where your CUDA Toolkit is installed, add the following two lines at the bottom of your profile ``~/.profile``.

    .. code-block:: console

        PATH="$PATH:$/usr/local/cuda-13.0/bin"
        LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$/usr/local/cuda-13.0/lib64"

.. note::
    
	Windows Users:

	Ensure that the environment variable ``CUDA_PATH`` is set to the folder where the CUDA Toolkit is installed. Also, ensure that the environment variable ``PATH`` includes the path where
	CUDA Toolkit components are installed. 

    In addition, you have to tell Python where the CUDA dynamically linkable libraries (DLLs) are located. 
    
    Note that:
    
    If you are using CUDA Toolkit version 12.x, the runtume is usually installed at: ``C:\\Program Files\\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\\CUDA\\v12.9\\bin``
    If you are using CUDA Toolkit version 13.x, the runtume is usually installed at: ``C:\\Program Files\\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\\CUDA\\v13.0\\bin\\x64``

    Use the following lines at the top of your code, before importing QuantumRingsLib.

    .. code-block:: console

        import os
        import platform

        if platform.system() == "Windows":
            cuda_path = os.getenv("CUDA_PATH", "")
            if "" == cuda_path:
                #set a hard-coded path
                cuda_path = "C:\\Program Files\\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\\CUDA\\v13.0\\bin\\x64"
            else:
                #create from the environment
                if "13" in cuda_path:
                    cuda_path += "\\bin\\x64"
                else:
                    cuda_path += "\\bin"

            os.add_dll_directory(cuda_path)

        import QuantumRingsLib


If environment variables are not set correctly, linker errors will occur, and the SDK will not load. 
If you are a Windows user, see additional instructions in `Section 6` to set up the DLL search path with Python.

If you are using your university supercomputer or a cloud environment with NVIDIA GPUs, 
your system administrator may already have installed the necessary runtime components optimized for your hardware platform. 
You may only need to select the CUDA Toolkit module. Selecting the CUDA Toolkit is typically done using a module loader, as shown below. 
Browse the modules installed in your system and choose the most recent CUDA Toolkit. 
Note that your system may use a different way of loading runtime components.

.. code-block:: console

    module load cuda-12.6.1-gcc-12.1.0


**STEP - 5**

To install the Quantum Rings SDK, use the command appropriate for your CUDA Toolkit version:

If you are using CUDA Toolkit version 13.x:

.. code-block:: console

    pip install quantumrings-nvidia-gpu

or

.. code-block:: console

    pip install quantumrings[cuda13x]


If you are using CUDA Toolkit version 12.x:

.. code-block:: console

    pip install quantumrings[cuda12x]



**STEP - 6**

Try running the following Python program in your Jupyter notebook to ensure everything is functioning correctly.

.. code-block:: python

    # For Windows users. Linux users may skip this.
    # Setup the CUDA Toolkit path with Python
    import os
    import platform

    if platform.system() == "Windows":
        cuda_path = os.getenv("CUDA_PATH", "")
        if "" == cuda_path:
            #set a hard-coded path
            cuda_path = "C:\\Program Files\\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\\CUDA\\v13.0\\bin\\x64"
        else:
            #create from the environment
            if "13" in cuda_path:
                cuda_path += "\\bin\\x64"
            else:
                cuda_path += "\\bin"

        os.add_dll_directory(cuda_path)
    #
    #
    
    import QuantumRingsLib
    from QuantumRingsLib import QuantumRegister, AncillaRegister, ClassicalRegister, QuantumCircuit
    from QuantumRingsLib import QuantumRingsProvider
    from QuantumRingsLib import job_monitor
    from QuantumRingsLib import JobStatus
    from QuantumRingsLib import OptimizeQuantumCircuit
    from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
    import numpy as np
    import math

    provider = QuantumRingsProvider(token =<YOUR_TOKEN_HERE>, name=<YOUR_ACCOUNT_NAME_HERE>)
    backend = provider.get_backend("amber_quantum_rings")
    numberofqubits = 50
    shots = 100
    
    q = QuantumRegister(numberofqubits , 'q')
    c = ClassicalRegister(numberofqubits , 'c')
    qc = QuantumCircuit(q, c)

    qc.h(0)
    for i in range (qc.num_qubits - 1):
        qc.cnot(i, i + 1)

    qc.measure_all()

    job = backend.run(qc, shots=shots)
    job_monitor(job)

    result = job.result()
    counts = result.get_counts()
    print(counts)



Using the GPU Mode
------------------

Certain programs with a large number of qubits (> 22), complex entanglement, and many gate operations can benefit from using a GPU.


To switch to the GPU mode, select the ``amber_quantum_rings`` backend as follows:

.. code-block:: console

    backend = provider.get_backend("amber_quantum_rings")

To switch to the CPU mode, select the ``scarlet_quantum_rings`` backend as follows:

.. code-block:: console

    backend = provider.get_backend("scarlet_quantum_rings")

.. note::

   Programs with a few qubits and gate operations usually run faster on the CPU mode with the ``scarlet_quantum_rings`` backend. 
   You can also use the hybrid backend ``serin_quantum_rings`` backend, which uses CPU for most  operations and switches to the GPU mode for complex operations.


You can also store the backend name in the configuration file using the key ``backend`` and allow the method ``provider.get_backend`` select it automatically 
by not providing any arguments. To save the backend name in the configuration file, please follow the instructions in the SDK.
Once the backend name is saved in the configuration file, you can obtain the backend by providing no arguments to the ``provider.get_backend`` method as follows:

.. code-block:: console

    provider = QuantumRingsProvider()
    backend = provider.get_backend()


Installing on an AWS SageMaker instance
---------------------------------------


AWS SageMaker instances may not be preconfigured with the CUDA runtime. To install the CUDA runtime, open a terminal from the Jupyter notebook. Ensure that you are a 
`root` user with read rights in your working folder. Follow the instructions found in the link : `CUDA Toolkit <https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit>`_ 
to install the toolkit corresponding to the driver version. You may not be allowed to update the CUDA drivers. You may want to disable this from the installation process. 
Set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and `PATH` as directed, or export them from a cell in the Jupyter notebook.  Install `quantumrings-nvidia-gpu` as 
described in this document.


Using a hybrid Mode
-------------------

On personal computers with a NVIDIA GPU containing lower memory, running the quantum circuit in a hybrid mode can be useful. In the hybrid mode,
most operations are done by the CPU utilizing the CPU memory. Certain complex operations involving large matrices are offloaded to the GPU for added performance.
To use the hybrid mode, select the `serin_quantum_rings` engine.

.. code-block:: console

	backend = provider.get_backend("serin_quantum_rings")
