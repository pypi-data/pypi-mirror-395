    """Decorator to mark a controller method as an HTTP DELETE endpoint.

    Convenience wrapper around @route that automatically sets the HTTP method
    to DELETE. Supports all FastAPI route configuration options.

        response_model: Pydantic model for response serialization.
        status_code: HTTP status code for successful responses.
        tags: OpenAPI tags for grouping endpoints.
        dependencies: FastAPI dependencies to inject.
        summary: Short summary for OpenAPI documentation.
        description: Detailed description for OpenAPI documentation.
        response_description: Description of successful response.
        responses: Additional response schemas for OpenAPI.
        deprecated: Whether this endpoint is deprecated.
        operation_id: Custom OpenAPI operation ID.
        response_model_include: Fields to include in response model.
        response_model_exclude: Fields to exclude from response model.
        response_model_by_alias: Use field aliases in response.
        response_model_exclude_unset: Exclude unset fields from response.
        response_model_exclude_defaults: Exclude fields with default values.
        response_model_exclude_none: Exclude None values from response.
        include_in_schema: Include in OpenAPI schema.
        response_class: FastAPI response class to use.
        name: Display name for the route.
        route_class_override: Custom APIRoute class.
        callbacks: OpenAPI callbacks configuration.
        openapi_extra: Additional OpenAPI schema data.

    Returns:
        A decorator function that marks the method as a DELETE endpoint.
