# repligit
`repligit` is a Python library that implements the Git transfer protocol. It enables users to query remote repositories, mirror repositories between two locations without storing state locally, and incrementally archive repositories to disk. `repligit` is used by [Hubcast](https://github.com/llnl/hubcast) to mirror repositories from GitHub to GitLab for secure CI/CD on local hardware.

## Installation
You can install repligit from PyPI using pip:

```bash
pip install repligit
```

## Features
- Query remote Git repositories.
- Mirror repositories between different Git hosting services.
- Incrementally archive repositories to disk.
- Implements Git transfer protocol in pure Python.

## Example Usage
```python
from repligit import fetch_pack, ls_remote, send_pack


def main():
    src_remote_url = "https://github.com/spack/spack.git"
    dest_remote_url = "https://gitlab.com/test-org/test-repo.git"

    branch_name = "main"

    target_ref = f"refs/heads/{branch_name}"

    # Authentication credentials
    # Note: Only provide credentials when authentication is required
    # src_username = "<username>"  # Uncomment if source repo requires auth
    # src_password = "<token>"     # Uncomment if source repo requires auth
    dest_username = "<username>"   # For destination repo write access
    dest_password = "<token>"      # For destination repo write access

    # List references from source repository (without authentication)
    gh_refs = ls_remote(src_remote_url)

    # List references from destination repository (with authentication)
    gl_refs = ls_remote(
        dest_remote_url,
        username=dest_username,
        password=dest_password
    )

    want_sha = gh_refs[target_ref]
    have_shas = set(gl_refs.values())

    from_sha = gl_refs.get(target_ref) or ("0" * 40)

    if want_sha in have_shas:
        print("Everything is up to date")
        return

    # Fetch the packfile from source repository
    packfile = fetch_pack(
        src_remote_url,
        want_sha,
        have_shas,
        # username=src_username,  # Uncomment if source repo requires auth
        # password=src_password,  # Uncomment if source repo requires auth
    )

    # Upload packfile to destination repository
    send_pack(
        dest_remote_url,
        target_ref,
        from_sha,
        want_sha,
        packfile,
        username=dest_username,
        password=dest_password,
    )


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
