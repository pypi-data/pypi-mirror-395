    Launch multiple TurboGEPA workers as local processes.

    This helper is a convenience for local experimentation. It mirrors the
    arguments of ``run_worker_from_factory`` but spawns ``worker_count``
    separate processes, each with its own event loop and HTTP client.

    Args:
        factory: Import path to a callable returning DefaultAdapter or
            (DefaultAdapter, seeds), e.g. ``\"examples.modal_turbo_aime:adapter_factory\"``.
        worker_count: Number of worker processes to launch.
        islands_per_worker: Optional islands per worker override.
        seeds: Optional shared seed list for all workers.
        max_rounds: Optional maximum rounds per worker.
        max_evaluations: Optional evaluation budget per worker.
        control_dir: Shared control directory for stop files.
        run_id: Global run identifier shared by all workers.
        display_progress: Whether each worker logs progress.
        enable_auto_stop: Whether to enable the stop governor.
