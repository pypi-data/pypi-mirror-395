# argpca: Adaptive Reference-Guided PCA for High-Dimension, Low-Sample Size Data

`argpca` is a Python implementation of **Adaptive Reference-Guided PCA (ARG-PCA)**,  
a method designed for **high-dimension, low-sample-size (HDLSS)** data when **prior  information** about the true PC subspace is available, proposed in 
*[Yoon and Jung (2025)](<https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/sta4.70081>)*.

## Why ARG-PCA?

Classical PCA performs poorly in HDLSS settings: the sample PC subspace is **inconsistent**,  
and the principal angles between the sample and true PC subspaces converge to a *non-zero*  
random limit. When **prior information** is available---such as domain-specific directions  
known (or believed) to be aligned with the true PC subspace---ARG-PCA leverages this to  
improve estimation accuracy. A representative example is the normalized vector of ones,  
often used in financial applications to reflect the common market factor,  
as in the capital asset pricing model. The ARG PC subspace estimator asymptotically  
outperforms the naive PCA based estimator. ARG-PCA is built based on ARG PC subspace estimator.

## Features

- **ARG PC subspace estimator** (`compute_arg_pc_subspace`)
- **ARG-PCA** (`ARGPCA`) with a scikit-learn–compatible API  
- **Fast PCA for HDLSS settings** via Gram-matrix eigen-decomposition  
- **Simulation and real-data examples** reproducing the empirical results in *[Yoon and Jung (2025)](<https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/sta4.70081>)*

## Quick Start

### ARG-PCA

```python
import numpy as np
from argpca.pca import ARGPCA

# X: (n, p) data matrix
# V: (r, p) reference vectors (rows)
X = ...
V = ...

model = ARGPCA(n_components=2)
model.fit(X, reference_vectors=V)

scores     = model.transform(X)     # (n, 2)
components = model.components_      # (2, p)
```

### ARG PC subspace estimator

```python
from argpca.pca import compute_arg_pc_subspace

U_arg = compute_arg_pc_subspace(
    samples=X,
    reference_vectors=V,
    n_components=2,
)
```

## Public API

```python
from argpca import ARGPCA, compute_arg_pc_subspace

# advanced / low-level utilities
from argpca import utils
# or, more explicitly:
from argpca.utils import GramSpectrum, compute_gram_spectrum, recover_spike_directions
```

## Running the Simulations

To reproduce the simulation results from of the paper, run:

```bash
python examples/simulation/simulation.py
```

Results are stored under:

```
examples/simulation/results/
```

## Real Data Example (NASDAQ 2024-12)

To reproduce the real data analysis results of the paper, run:

```bash
python examples/realdata/realdata.py
```

This script generates a scatter plot comparing:

- ARGPCA PC1–PC2 scores  
- Standard PCA PC1–PC2 scores  

Saved as:

```
examples/realdata/nasdaq_2024_12_pc_scores.png
```

For reference vectors, normalized vector of ones and 2024 mean log-returns were used.
