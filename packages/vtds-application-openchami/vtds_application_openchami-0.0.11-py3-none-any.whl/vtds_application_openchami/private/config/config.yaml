  # The deployment section specifies which of the available deployment
  # modes is to be used to deploy OpenCHAMI and any configuration
  # specific to that deployment mode that might be needed.
  #
  # The modes are:
  #
  #   'quadlet'    - a deployment mode that deploys OpenCHAMI into
  #                  systemd managed podman quadlets loosely based on
  #                  the OpenCHAMI 2025 Tutorial, but with support for
  #                  a cluster of Virtual Compute Nodes running directly
  #                  on Virtual Blade hosts and with support for
  #                  Magellan discovery of those Virtual Compute Nodes.
  #
  #   'bare'       - a deployment that finishes without OpenCHAMI
  #                  deployed at all, but with a management node
  #                  deployed that is ready for the 2025 Tutorial to be
  #                  run on it.

  # The host block identifies the Virtual Network on which OpenCHAMI is
  # hosted and the Virtual Node class whose instances will run
  # OpenCHAMI. Deployment will be done to all nodes in that class (for a
  # single instance of OpenCHAMI the cluster configuration should
  # specify only one instance of the host node class.

  # The discovery_networks map is a collection of network specifications
  # for networks on which OpenCHAMI (currently Magellan) may do
  # discovery of RedFish endpoints. A discovery network may be either a
  # Cluster Network, identified by a network name from the Cluster layer
  # configuration, or an internal network, with no network name but an
  # explicit network CIDR. Either a network CIDR or a network name must
  # be supplied. If both or neither is supplied this is an error. If a
  # given cluster does not contain the network named in a Cluster
  # Network, that network will be removed from the set of discovery
  # networks prior to deployment.
  #
  # All of the valid networks specified here will be used for discovery
  # of RedFish endpoints when OpenCHAMI is deployed.
