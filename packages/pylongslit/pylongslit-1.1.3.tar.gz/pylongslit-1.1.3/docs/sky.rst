Modelled sky subtraction
========================

.. note:: 
    For some datasets, if you already have subtracted the sky background by using
    :ref:`A-B background subtraction <AB>`, you might be able to skip this step.
    This is the case for the SDSS_J213510+2728 tutorial dataset, where the sky
    subtraction by the A-B method is so successful, that practically all background 
    is removed. However, for some datasets, you will need to perform this step 
    even if you have already subtracted the sky background by the A-B method - 
    inspect the files after the A-B routine to see if there is any remaining sky background.
    It is important to note that any procedure performed in the pipeline introduces
    some error noise (see :ref:`note on uncertainties <uncertainties>`), so you must consider what is your best option, or test different 
    approaches.

Quickstart
-----------

The procedure is called by the command:

.. code-block:: bash

    pylongslit_sky_subtract PATH_TO_CONFIG_FILE

The procedure will estimate a sky-model using polynomial fitting, and 
subtract this model from the reduced files in the output directory specified in the
configuration file. The procedure will alter the reduced files in-place. There 
are some interactive parts of the procedure, where you can also skip sky-subtraction
for certain frames if you wish - this is explained in more detail below.

The procedure will start by plotting all the reduced frames one at a time, and 
you will have to mark the object center by clicking on the object trace. You can also 
choose to skip the sky-subtraction of a frame by not clicking on the object trace 
and simply closing the window. Below is an example of the interactive window for the
GQ1218+0832 dataset, with prior and after object choice:

.. image:: pictures/sky_prior.png
    :width: 100%
    :align: center

.. image:: pictures/sky_post.png
    :width: 100%
    :align: center

From then on, the procedure will estimate the sky background using polynomial fitting, and subtract it.

Quality Assessment
------------------

The routine fits a polynomial to the sky background for every spectral pixel. A 
sample for one fit (corresponding to the coordinates of the manually chosen object center) will be 
shown for quality assessment:

.. image:: pictures/sky_QA.png
    :width: 100%
    :align: center

A good fit is defined by:

#. Random residual spread around 0. 
#. Very strong outliers rejected. 
#. The object is encapsulated completely by the red lines.

The software will then plot the whole sky model:

.. image:: pictures/sky_model.png
    :width: 100%
    :align: center

And the observation frames before and after subtraction:

.. image:: pictures/sky_original.png
    :width: 100%
    :align: center

.. image:: pictures/sky_subtracted.png
    :width: 100%
    :align: center

The subtracted frame should show a clear reduction of the sky background, with the 
remaining background being mostly noise. The object should be clearly visible after subtraction, and should not 
be present in the sky-model. 


Parameter options
------------------

These parameters can be adjusted in the configuration file to control the fit, 
with example values:

.. code::

    "sky" : {
        "sigma_cut": 3,
        "sigma_clip_iters": 5,
        "fit_order": 2
    },

    "trace" : {
        "object": {
            "fwhm_guess": 4,
            "fwhm_thresh": 2,
        },
        "standard": {
            "fwhm_guess": 4,
            "fwhm_thresh": 3,
        }
    }

The ``"sigma_cut"`` and ``"sigma_clip_iters"`` parameters control the rejection of outliers in the sky model fitting.
They are passed to `astropy.stats.sigma_clip <https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/api/astropy.stats.sigma_clip.html>`_ , 
where ``"sigma_cut"`` is the number of standard deviations to use for the rejection, and ``"sigma_clip_iters"`` 
is the maximum number of iterations to perform (stops earlier if convergence is reached). 
The ``"fit_order"`` parameter decides what order polynomial to fit to the sky background.

The ``"fwhm_guess"`` and ``"fwhm_thresh"`` parameters are used to estimate the limits of the objects 
(can be set differently for science and standard star frames). The red lines you see on the plot
above are defined as: object center +/- 3 ``"fwhm_guess"`` +/- ``"fwhm_thresh"`` (in pixels).

For users new to data reduction - short introduction to sky background
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sky background is the light from the sky and the atmosphere that is recorded by the detector together
with the object spectrum. This background light covers
the whole slit, and the background therefore shows itself as lines through the whole spatial direction
(see above figures). The sky background consists of both strong sky lines (emission lines from the sky) and 
a continuum background. These sky lines/background are mixed into the object signal, and must be removed.
