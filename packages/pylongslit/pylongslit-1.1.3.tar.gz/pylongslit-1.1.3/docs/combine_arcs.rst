.. _combine_arcs:

Combining arc frames
====================

Quickstart
-----------

The command for running the arc frame combination procedure is called by:

.. code-block:: bash

    pylongslit_combine_arcs PATH_TO_CONFIG_FILE

The arc frames are (optionally) bias-subtracted and then simply summed together.
The output is a single arc frame ``master_arc.fits``, which is saved in the output directory 
specified in the configuration file. The frame is automatically rotated 
and flipped so it is oriented with x being the spectral axis, with 
the wavelength increasing from left to right - this is the default 
orientation for the rest of the software, after the raw data has been
processed.

Quality Assessment
------------------

The arc combining procedure will show the final master arc upon exiting. You can 
press ``h`` to normalize the master arc to emphasize the contrast
between the arc lines and the background - however, this might exaggerate the 
very faint lines to be more visible than they actually are. The documentation for your instrument
should have a map of the expected arc lines and their wavelengths - you can use it
to check if the arc lines are visible and the expected range of the detector 
is covered (a common error is if a lamp from one ion is forgotten to be
included in the input directory, meaning a certain wavelength range is not being covered by the arc lines).
The example below is from the example data set GQ1218+0832 from GTC OSIRIS both before and after 
normalization:

    :width: 100%
    :align: center

.. image:: pictures/master_arc_normalized.png
    :width: 100%
    :align: center

Inspecting the arc map from `OSIRIS webpage <https://www.gtc.iac.es/instruments/osiris/media/R1000B.jpg>`_ ,
it is possible to see that overall pattern of the arc-lines is as expected:

Parameter options
------------------

The relevant parameters for the arc combining procedure are (with example values):

.. code:: 

    "arc" : {
        "arc_dir": "/home/kostas/Documents/PyLongslit_dev/SDSS_J213510+2728/arcs"
    },

    "combine_arcs" : {
        "skip_bias": false
    }

If you set ``"skip_bias": true``, the bias subtraction will be skipped. This 
is sometimes useful for instruments where the detector gain is different for 
the regular calibration frames and the arc frames, since this can force the 
noise in the arc frames to become negative - resulting in numerical issues.

The ``arc_dir`` parameter specifies the directory where the raw arc frames are located.
No other type of frames should be present in this directory.

For users new to data reduction - short introduction to arc lamp frames
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Arc lamp frames are used to wavelength calibrate the detector,
i.e. to assign a wavelength to each pixel in the detector. This procedure is 
described in detail in the :ref:`wavelength calibration section <wavecalib>`. Every 
raw arc lamp frame has an emission spectrum of one or several ions with known wavelengths. 
In this step the arc frames are
combined to create a single master arc frame, so the wavelength calibration can be done
on a single frame, instead of on each individual arc frame.
