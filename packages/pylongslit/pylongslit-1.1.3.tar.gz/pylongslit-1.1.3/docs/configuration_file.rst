Configuration files
===================

The configuration file is a ``.json`` file that contains all the parameters
that are needed to run the software. The file is divided into sections, 
each corresponding to a different step in the pipeline.

Every pipeline command takes the configuration file as input. From the 
configuration file the software knows where to look for the data, what to do with it,
and where to save the results. Every call has the following format:

.. code:: bash

    pylongslit_command PATH_TO_CONFIG_FILE

For example, if the command is the bias procedure ``pylongslit_bias``, and
the configuration file is located at ``/home/documents/SDSS_J213510+2728.json``,
the command would be:

.. code:: bash

    pylongslit_bias /home/documents/SDSS_J213510+2728.json

When first seeing the configuration file, the many parameters can be overwhelming, but most of them are 
constant for a given instrument. This means that once you have set them up
for a single successful run for your instrument, you can reuse most of the configuration file
for future runs.

**See the page on** :ref:`already tested instruments <tested_instruments>`
**for configuration files that have been tested**.

For a new instrument, you can
try to **reuse a configuration file from another instrument**, and change only
the parameters that are corrupting the run.

The software has a method for checking the configuration file for errors 
(it checks if the provided file paths exist, the raw data directories have files in them, some sanity checks 
on the parameters, etc.). The method can be called by:

.. code:: bash

    pylongslit_check_config PATH_TO_CONFIG_FILE

It is not mandatory to use this method, but it is highly recommended before 
actually starting to process the data.

An example of a configuration file is shown below, followed by an 
explanation of every parameter. In the :ref:`tutorial <tutorial>`, even more
detailed explanation of the parameters is given.
