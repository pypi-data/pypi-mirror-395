.. _developer:

Interested in developing?
==========================

PyLongslit is a young project, and we welcome contributions from anyone who is interested in helping out (**including students**). 
If you're interested in contributing, please contact: 

kostas.valeckas@nbi.ku.dk

The format of collaboration is flexible, but a few things are pre-determined:

1. We use `GitHub <https://github.com/>`_ for version control.
2. We do not compromise on the principles of simplicity, manual execution, transparency and robustness.
3. We aim to provide a welcoming and inclusive environment for all contributors.

If you would like to make your own version without contributing to the main project, 
you can fork the repository and make your own changes. You will need to 
:ref:`install an editable version of the software <dev_install>`.
