General Notes on using the pipeline
====================================

This section contains general nice-to-know information on useful 
features of the pipeline.


Controlling the plots displayed with `Matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/>`_.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The pipeline produces a large array of quality assessment plots. All of these
are displayed using `Matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/>`_. All the plots
have a menu bar that gives you access to a wide range of options. You can 
zoom in and out, save the plot, set limits for the axes, limit image contrast,
and many more. How the menu looks for different systems varies. For Linux 
Ubuntu, the menu looks like this (located in the upper left corner): 

.. image:: pictures/matplotlib.png
    :width: 100%
    :align: center

For your system the menu might look different, but the options are pretty much
the same.

A few outliers in a frame can make the colormap of ``matplotlib`` disproportionate in 
the sense that the details in the frame are not visible. Therefore, most of the detector 
image plots produced by the software can be aggressively normalized by pressing the ``h`` button 
on your keyboard. Please note that the errors then are also normalized from 0 to 1 - and not 
re-calculated based on the normalized data.

Spectral axis vs. Spatial axis
-------------------------------

The software and the docs use the terms *spectral axis* and *spatial axis*
to refer to the two axes of the 2D spectrum. The *spectral axis* is the
axis along which the wavelength values are displayed, and the *spatial axis*
is the axis along which the spatial position of the object is displayed:

Overall pipeline architecture
-----------------------------

In a broad sense, there
are three stages of the data processing, all explained in separate figures. The diamond shapes in the figures represent different pipeline routines that 
are called directly from the command line, solid arrows are hard-dependencies (must-have), dashed arrows are soft-dependencies (can use) and the rectangles represent input files 
and pipeline products.

.. figure:: pictures/raw_processing.png
    :align: center
    :width: 100%
    :alt: Step 1 - processing raw data

    Step 1 - processing raw data. In this step, all the raw observation and calibration frames are used to construct calibrated 2D spectra. After this step, all procedures are performed directly on the calibrated 2D spectra, and the raw frames are no longer used.

.. figure:: pictures/further_processing.png
    :align: center
    :width: 100%
    :alt: Step 2 - further processing of the calibrated 2D spectra

    Step 2 - further processing of the calibrated 2D spectra. In this step, the user can deploy cosmic-ray removal, sky-background subtraction, and crop the spectra. All procedures alter the 2D spectra in place. All of the steps are optional, but there are some dependencies — these are described in the figure.

.. figure:: pictures/1d_extraction.png
    :align: center
    :width: 100%
    :alt: Step 3 - 1D spectrum extraction

    Step 3 - 1D spectrum extraction. In this step, objects are traced, extracted, flux calibrated and combined (if several spectra of the same object exist).
