Cropping of images
==================

.. note:: 
    This procedure is not necessary for the pipeline to work, but can improve 
    the quality of :ref:`sky-subtraction <sky>` and :ref:`object-tracing <objtrace>`.
    If you are using :ref:`A-B background subtraction <ab>`, you should crop the images
    only after the A-B subtraction, else the subtraction can be misaligned.


Quickstart
-----------

The procedure is called by the command:

.. code-block:: bash

    pylongslit_crop PATH_TO_CONFIG_FILE

The procedure will start an interactive window where you can use two sliders 
to crop the image in the spatial direction (you can press "h" to normalize if the image is too dark):

.. image:: pictures/crop_full.png
    :width: 100%
    :align: center

This cropping can help with 
later :ref:`sky-subtraction <sky>` and :ref:`object-tracing <objtrace>`. From experience, 
it is best to crop the image such that a sufficient amount of sky is left on the image - around 100 pixels on each side of the object trace, as this allows for 
better sky estimation. You also don't want the object too close to the edges when 
performing :ref:`object-tracing <objtrace>`. A cropped science image that shows good end-results
for the GQ1218+0832 dataset is shown below as an example:


.. image:: pictures/gtc_crop.png
    :width: 100%
    :align: center
