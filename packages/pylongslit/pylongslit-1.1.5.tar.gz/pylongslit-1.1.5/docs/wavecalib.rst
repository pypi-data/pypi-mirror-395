Wavelength Calibration
======================

The wavelength calibration procedure in the software is by far the most complex
and abstract part of the pipeline. In order to utilize the spatial information
obtained by a long-slit spectrograph, the software needs to account for both 
spectral and spatial features in the wavelength calibration. This complicates the 
code and the user interface, but it is deemed necessary in order to achieve the
needed precision for a long-slit observation.

Quick start
-----------

The wavelength calibration routine is executed by the following call:

.. code:: bash
    
   pylongslit_wavecalib PATH_TO_CONFIG_FILE

The routine will produce a large amount of quality assessment plots, and will 
write 4 files to the output directory:
``good_lines.pkl, reidentified_lines.pkl, wavelen_fit.pkl, wavelength_map.fits``.
The meaning of the plots and the files will be explained in the following sections.

Since the wavelength calibration is a complex process, the quality assessment plots
and the parameters will be explained together in the following sections, as 
this might help to understand how the parameters affect the quality of the calibration.

There are 2 major steps in the routine: **line reidentification** and 
**tilt tracing**.

.. _line_reidentification:

Line reidentification
----------------------

In this step, the centers of the :ref:`manually identified lines from the previous step <identify>` 
are refined using generalized Gaussian fits. The refined line centers are then used to
fit a polynomial to the pixel vs. wavelength relation - this polynomial is 
called the **1d wavelength solution**. It will later, together with the :ref:`tilt estimation <tilts>`,
be used to map every pixel in the detector to a wavelength.

Firstly, the reidentification step will plot the Gaussian fits of the lines,
as shown in the following figure from the SDSS_J213510+2728 tutorial dataset:

   :width: 100%
   :align: center

Zoomed in on one line:

.. image:: pictures/reid_zoom.png
   :width: 100%
   :align: center

If you see good fits being rejected, bad fits being accepted, or the fits 
simply failing (some are expected to fail, but not the majority), you can
try tweaking these ``"wavecalib"`` parameters:

``"offset_middle_cut"``: The 1d line spectrum is taken from the middle of the image. 
Sometimes, the middle of the image is not the best place, 
so the ``offset_middle_cut`` parameter can be used to offset the cut from the middle 
by a certain amount of pixels

``"pixel_cut_extension"``: this parameter is used to decide how many detector rows to use for the
1d-spectrum cut. If ``pixel_cut_extension`` is set to 0, only one row will be used. If it is set to 2,
the middle row +/- 2 rows will be used and then averaged and so forth. This is useful if the arc line spectrum 
is noisy, as averaging removes some of the noise. However, the cut should not be wider than necessary, as the line centers change gradually 
in the spatial direction.

``"FWHM"``: the initial guess for the FWHM of the lines.

``"TOL_FWHM"``: the tolerance for deviation the fitted FWHM may have from
the initial guess.

``"TOL_MEAN"``: the tolerance for deviation the fitted center may have from 
the :ref:`manually identified center <identify>`.

``"REIDENTIFY_R2_TOL"``: the tolerance for the :math:`R^2` value of the fit. If the :math:`R^2` value is below this value, the fit is rejected.

After the lines have been reidentified, the 1d wavelength solution is fitted to the
reidentified lines. An example of the 1d wavelength solution is shown in the following figure (RMS is given in Å):

.. image:: pictures/1d_wavelen_sol.png
    :width: 100%
    :align: center

You should try to get a good fit with random residuals with the lowest possible degree of the polynomial.
The parameter that sets the degree is ``"ORDER_WAVELEN_1D"``. Be aware that if the lines have been reidentified 
with errors (e.g. too relaxed :math:`R^2` tolerance), that it might also affect the 1d wavelength solution.

.. _tilts:

Tilt tracing
----------------------

The arc lines can have a tilt in the spatial direction. This is very prominent 
when inspecting the master arc from the GQ1218+5709 tutorial dataset:

.. image:: pictures/master_arc_normalized.png
    :width: 100%
    :align: center

As the wavelength is constant along every arc line, we need to estimate the tilt
through the whole of the detector in order to map the 1d wavelength solution to the
2d detector.

Firstly, the tilt tracing algorithm estimates the position of every line on the 
detector. This is done the same way as in the :ref:`line reidentification <line_reidentification>`,
but now the fit is not done for one center, but through the whole spatial direction, as 
shown below:

.. image:: pictures/line_trace_zoom.png
    :width: 100%
    :align: center

When the tracing is done, the spatial coordinate at where the 1d wavelength solution
was evaluated is set to have tilt = 0. The tilt of every line is estimated based on how much a given spatial pixel 
deviates from the tilt = 0 spatial coordinate. The tilt is
then fitted with a polynomial for every line. The tilt fit for every line is
plotted together with residuals for quality assessment, as shown here from the
GQ1218+5709 tutorial dataset:

.. image:: pictures/tilt_all_gtc.png
    :width: 100%
    :align: center

Zoom in on one line:

.. image:: pictures/tilt_zoom_gtc.png
    :width: 100%
    :align: center

.. image:: pictures/tilt_resid_zoom.png
    :width: 100%
    :align: center

The tilt in this example is estimated with tilt = 0 set at the spatial pixel
1028. The residuals show structure in the magnitude of 0.01 pixel. From experience, 
this is hard to avoid, and should not have a large impact on the final wavelength 
when the magnitude is this low.

Several parameters can be set if the individual line tilt estimation is accepting 
bad fits, rejecting good fits, identifying lines in the wrong place or alike. 

For the individual center tracing through the spatial direction, the same parameters
apply as in :ref:`line reidentification <line_reidentification>`. The only difference 
is that the :math:`R^2` threshold for the individual Gaussian fits is set by the 
``"TILT_TRACE_R2_TOL"`` parameter. In experience, the :math:`R^2` value can be 
set lower than in the ``"REIDENTIFY_R2_TOL"`` parameter, as the tilt tracing is
lastly estimated by a polynomial fit, so a few outliers are okay.

The parameter ``"TILT_REJECT_LINE_FRACTION"`` is used to abort a line trace if the
fraction of rejected fits is above this value. This optimizes the computational time
and ensures that badly identified lines do not get accepted as false positives.

The parameter ``"jump_tolerance"`` is used to set the maximum jump in pixels a line can
have from one estimated center to another. This can help identify lines that are close
to each other.

The order of the polynomial tilt for individual line tilts is set by the 
``"ORDER_SPATIAL_TILT"`` parameter. The :math:`R^2` threshold for fit rejection 
is set by the ``"SPACIAL_R2_TOL"`` parameter.

When the individual lines are identified, the line traces are plotted for 
quality assessment:

.. image:: pictures/all_line_trace.png
    :width: 100%
    :align: center

Inspect if the lines are traced correctly, especially that traces do not 
jump between neighboring lines.

Lastly, the estimated tilts throughout the detector are used to perform 
a 2d tilt polynomial fit with the spatial order ``"ORDER_SPATIAL_TILT"`` and the
spectral order ``"ORDER_SPECTRAL_TILT"``. The residuals are plotted along both
the spatial and spectral direction for quality assessment:

.. image:: pictures/tilt_2d_fit_residual.png
    :width: 100%
    :align: center

In spatial direction the residuals should be random, but very small scale structure
(order of 0.01 pixel) is hard to avoid. In the spectral direction, the residuals will be 
collected in columns where the arc lines are placed. The residuals here should also be 
dispersed around 0.

The individual lines are then plotted next to the 2d fit evaluated at the same
pixels as the individual lines:

.. image:: pictures/tilt_individual_vs_2_d.png
    :width: 100%
    :align: center

The plots should resemble each other greatly, with the lines at the plot
to the right showing smoother structure. If this is not the case, you 
will need to revise the whole tilt fitting procedure.

**At this point, all the fitting and calculations are done.**

The tilt detector map and the wavelength map is produced as a last 
sanity-check. You should see a smooth continuum in both. Also, check 
that the wavelength range is as expected for your instrument, filter and disperser
combination:

    :width: 100%
    :align: center

Reusing past products in the wavelength calibration
---------------------------------------------------

When adjusting the many parameters in this procedure, it is sometimes useful to 
reuse some of the products and for example jump straight to the tilt tracing 
if the line reidentification is already working correctly.

The parameters for this are (all can be set to either true or false):

.. code::

    "wavecalib": {
        "reuse_reided_lines": # loads the file reidentified_lines.pkl from the output directory, this file holds the reidentified line centers
        "reuse_1d_sol": # loads the file wavelen_fit.pkl from the output directory, this file holds the 1d wavelength solution
        "reuse_line_traces": # loads the file good_lines.pkl from the output directory, this file holds the individual line traces
        "reuse_2d_tilt_fit": # loads the file tilt_fit.pkl from the output directory, this file holds the 2d tilt fit
    }

How the wavelength solution gets evaluated
------------------------------------------

It can be conceptually hard to understand how the wavelengths get mapped to the 
detector pixels with the abstract procedure described above. The below explanation 
is an attempt to clarify this.

For the spatial pixel :math:`y_{0}` at which the 1d wavelength solution :math:`f` is known, the 
wavelength :math:`\lambda` can be decided by 
:math:`\lambda = f(x_{0})`, where :math:`x_{0}` is the spectral pixel. For any other pixel :math:`(x,y)`, we 
know the tilt :math:`\Delta x` that transforms :math:`x` to :math:`x_{0}` while keeping the wavelength constant. 
We evaluate the wavelength at pixel :math:`(x,y)` by :math:`\lambda = f(x - \Delta x)`:
