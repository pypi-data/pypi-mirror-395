title = {AN OPTIMAL EXTRACTION ALGORITHM FOR CCD SPECTROSCOPY.},
journal = {Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific},
abstract = {An optimal spectrum extraction procedure is described, and examples of its performance with CCD data are presented. The algorithm delivers the maximum possible signal-to-noise ratio while preserving spectrophotometric accuracy. The effects of moderate geometric distortion and of cosmic-ray hits on the spectrum are automatically accounted for. In tests with background-noise limited CCD spectra, optimal extraction offers a 70-percent gain in effective exposure time in comparison with conventional extraction procedures.}
