         Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
         Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
         of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
        
        
          This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
        the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
        License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.
        
          0. Additional Definitions.
        
          As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
        General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU
        General Public License.
        
          "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,
        other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.
        
          An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided
        by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
        Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
        of using an interface provided by the Library.
        
          A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an
        Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
        with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked
        Version".
        
          The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
        Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
        for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
        based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.
        
          The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the
        object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
        and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
        Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.
        
          1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.
        
          You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
        without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.
        
          2. Conveying Modified Versions.
        
          If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
        facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
        that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
        facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
        version:
        
           a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
           ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
           function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
           whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or
        
           b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
           this License applicable to that copy.
        
          3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.
        
          The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
        a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
        code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
        material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
        layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
        (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:
        
           a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
           Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
           covered by this License.
        
           b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
           document.
        
          4. Combined Works.
        
          You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
        taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
        portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
        engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
        the following:
        
           a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
           the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
           covered by this License.
        
           b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
           document.
        
           c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
           execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
           these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
           copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.
        
           d) Do one of the following:
        
               0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
               License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
               suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
               recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
               the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
               manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
               Corresponding Source.
        
               1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
               Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
               a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
               system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
               of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
               Version.
        
           e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
           be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
           GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
           necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
           Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
           Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
           you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
           the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
           Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
           Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
           for conveying Corresponding Source.)
        
          5. Combined Libraries.
        
          You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
        Library side by side in a single library together with other library
        facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
        License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
        choice, if you do both of the following:
        
           a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
           on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
           conveyed under the terms of this License.
        
           b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
           is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
           accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
        
          6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.
        
          The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
        of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
        versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
        differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
        
          Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
        Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
        of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"
        applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
        conditions either of that published version or of any later version
        published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
        received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
        General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
        General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
        
          If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
        whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
        apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
        permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
        Library.

[![PyPI - Python Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/pyrobird.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/pyrobird)

-----

## Installation

```bash
pip install pyrobird
```

Optional dependencies:

- `batch` - install playwright, that allows to make screenshots in batch mode
- `xrootd` - install libraries to read xrootd located files and URLs starting with `root://`
- `dev` - install pytest and other development requirements, mainly to run tests

If using `batch` for screenshots, after installing playwright, you need to install browser binaries:

```bash
python -m playwright install chromium
```

If installed via pip, `xrootd` library requires compilation, so the system should have cmake,
compiler and some xrootd dependencies installed.

For debian/ubuntu the packages to install to use xrootd: 

```bash
sudo apt install build-essential libxrootd-client-dev cmake zlib1g-dev uuid-dev libssl-dev python3-dev

```

Development installation 

It is recommended to use [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)

```bash
cd pyrobird                 # directory inside main firebird repo. NOT pyrobird/pyrobird - this is lib
uv venv                     # create virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate   # activate it
uv sync                     # install all requirements
```

Still possible without uv

```bash
python -m pip install --editable .[dev,batch]

# with xrootd
python -m pip install --editable .[dev,batch,xrootd]
```

Running with Gunicorn (development mode)

```bash
gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:5454 pyrobird.server:flask_app --log-level debug --capture-output
```


## Contributing

- [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) is required
- [Use Numpy style dockstring comments](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html)
- [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) is used for unit tests. Aim for comprehensive coverage of the new code.
- Utilize [type hints](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html) wherever is possible to enhance readability and reduce errors.
- Use of specific exceptions for error handling is better. As described in the [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html) rather than general exceptions.

- Manage dependencies appropriately. Add new dependencies to `pyproject.toml`. Provide a justification for new dependencies

## Testing

To install dependencies with testing libraries included 

```bash
pip install .[test]
```

Navigate to the pyrobird/tests and execute:

```bash
pytest

# To stop immediately on error and enter debugging mode
pytest -x --pdb 
```


## Development install

```
python -m pip install --upgrade --editable  .[dev]
```

# Pyrobird Server

This server allows Firebird to work with local files and the local file system as
well as to complement frontend features such as opening XRootD files, etc.

Serve Pirobird locally and have access to files in current directory: 

```bash
pyrobird serve
```

**pyrobird** (backend) allows **Firebird** (frontend) to access certain files on your system. 
For this reason pyrobird server has multiple endpoints such as `/api/v1/download` 
which allows to download files. There are library files served and by default Firebird
has access to files in your current directory or a directory provided via `--work-path` flag


#### **Available Options**

| Option                     | Short | Type    | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|----------------------------|-------|---------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `--allow-any-file`         |       | Flag    | `False` | Allow unrestricted access to download files in the system. When enabled, the server allows downloads of all files which the running user has access to. **Use with caution**: It is considered dangerous in production environments.            |
| `--allow-cors`             |       | Flag    | `False` | Enable CORS for downloaded files. This option should be used if you need to support web applications from different domains accessing the files, such as serving your server from a central Firebird server.                                       |
| `--disable-files`          |       | Flag    | `False` | Disable all file downloads from the server. This option will prevent any file from being downloaded, enhancing security by restricting file access.                                                                                              |
| `--work-path TEXT`         |       | String  | `CWD`   | Set the base directory path for file downloads. Defaults to the current working directory. Use this option to specify where the server should look for files when handling download requests.                                                       |


> `--allow-any-file` - allows unrestricted access to download files in a system.
> When enabled, the server allows downloads of all files that user has access to.
> When disabled - only files in `--work-path` and its subdirectories are allowed to be downloaded.
> This option could be considered safe on personal machines with a single user, 
> who runs localhost server in a terminal
> 
> (!) It is considered dangerous in all other cases: farms, interactive nodes, production environments, servers, etc.
> Just think `/etc/passwd` will be accessible through  `localhost:port/api/v1/download?f=/etc/passwd`
> 
> So security wise, it is better to use `--work-path` than `--allow-any-file`


- Start server with default settings, Firebird works with files in current directory:
   ```bash
  pyrobird serve
   ```

- Set where Firebird will take files from:
   
   ```bash
   pyrobird serve --work-path=/home/username/datafiles
   ```

   Now if you set file `local://filename.root` in Firebird UI,
   the file `/home/username/datafiles/filename.root` will be opened


## API Documentation

This is technical explanation of what is under the hood of the server part

## Features

- **Secure File Downloading**: Download files with access control to prevent unauthorized access.
- **EDM4eic Event Processing**: Extract and convert specific events from EDM4eic files to JSON.
- **Static File Serving**: Serve frontend assets seamlessly alongside API endpoints.
- **Dynamic Configuration**: Serve configuration files with real-time server information.
- **CORS Support**: Enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing for specified routes.

### Configuration Options
- **DOWNLOAD_PATH**: `str[getcwd()]`, Specifies the directory from which files can be downloaded when using relative paths.
- **PYROBIRD_DOWNLOAD_IS_DISABLED**: `bool[False]` If set to `True`, all download functionalities are disabled.
- **PYROBIRD_DOWNLOAD_IS_UNRESTRICTED**: `bool[False]`, allows unrestricted access to download any file, including sensitive ones.
- **CORS_IS_ALLOWED**: `bool[False]`, If set to `True`, enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for download routes.




The API provides endpoints for downloading files, processing EDM4eic events, and serving configuration files. It also includes static file serving for frontend assets.

---

### Download File

#### **Endpoint**

```
GET /api/v1/download
GET /api/v1/download/<path:filename>
```

#### **Description**

Allows users to download specified files. The download can be restricted based on configuration settings to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive files.

#### **Parameters**

- **Query Parameters**:
    - `filename` (optional): The name or path of the file to download.
    - `f` (optional): An alternative parameter for the filename.

- **Path Parameters**:
