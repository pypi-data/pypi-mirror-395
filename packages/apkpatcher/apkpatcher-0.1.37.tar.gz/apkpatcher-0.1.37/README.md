## GOAL

Library to patch apk (inject frida gadget)
this code is inspired by this project :https://github.com/badadaf/apkpatcher.

The improvements added by this fork are the following:  
- modification of xml files such as AndroidManifest without extracting the resources. Extracting the resources usually prevents to rebuild the apk.
- Use as an API
- Installation as a package

This project has received funding from the OSINT Got Talent program of <a href="https://epieos.com">EPIEOS</a>.
