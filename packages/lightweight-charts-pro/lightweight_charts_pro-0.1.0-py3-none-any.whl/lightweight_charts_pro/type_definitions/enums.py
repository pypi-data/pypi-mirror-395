"""Enum definitions for streamlit-lightweight-charts.

This module contains comprehensive enumeration types used throughout the library
for defining chart types, styling options, configuration parameters, and behavior
modes. These enums ensure type safety, provide a consistent interface for chart
configuration, and enable IntelliSense support for better developer experience.

The module provides enums for:
    - Chart types and visualization modes
    - Color and styling options
    - Line styles and types
    - Crosshair and interaction modes
    - Price scale and time scale configurations
    - Marker positions and shapes
    - Animation and tracking modes

These enums are designed to be compatible with TradingView's Lightweight Charts
library while providing a Python-native interface for configuration.

Key Features:
    - Type-safe enum values with proper string/int representations
    - Comprehensive coverage of all chart configuration options
    - Clear documentation for each enum value
    - Compatibility with frontend JavaScript enum values
    - IntelliSense support for IDE autocompletion

Example Usage:
    ```python
    from lightweight_charts_pro.type_definitions.enums import (
        ChartType,
        LineStyle,
        MarkerPosition,
        PriceScaleMode,
    )

    # Use enums for type-safe configuration
    chart_type = ChartType.CANDLESTICK
    line_style = LineStyle.SOLID
    marker_pos = MarkerPosition.ABOVE_BAR
    scale_mode = PriceScaleMode.NORMAL
    ```
