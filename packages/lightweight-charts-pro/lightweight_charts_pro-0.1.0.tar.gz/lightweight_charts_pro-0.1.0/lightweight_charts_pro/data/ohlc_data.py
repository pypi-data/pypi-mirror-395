"""OHLC data classes for Streamlit Lightweight Charts Pro.

This module provides data classes for OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) data points
used in candlestick and bar charts. The OhlcData class extends the base Data class
with OHLC-specific validation and serialization capabilities.

The module includes:
    - OhlcData: Data class for OHLC data points
    - OHLC relationship validation (high >= low, all values >= 0)
    - NaN handling and value normalization
    - Time normalization and serialization utilities

Key Features:
    - Automatic time normalization to UNIX timestamps
    - OHLC relationship validation (high must be >= low)
    - Non-negative value validation for all price fields
    - NaN value handling (converts NaN to 0.0)
    - Required field validation for all OHLC parameters
    - CamelCase serialization for frontend communication

Example Usage:
    ```python
    from lightweight_charts_pro.data import OhlcData

    # Create OHLC data point
    data = OhlcData(time="2024-01-01T00:00:00", open=100.0, high=105.0, low=98.0, close=102.0)

    # Serialize to frontend format
    serialized = data.asdict()
    ```

@dataclass
class OhlcData(Data):
    """Data class for OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) data points in financial charts.

    This class represents an OHLC data point commonly used in candlestick and bar charts
    for displaying financial market data. It extends the base Data class with OHLC-specific
    validation and serialization capabilities.

    The class automatically validates OHLC relationships (high >= low), ensures all values
    are non-negative, and handles NaN values for frontend compatibility.

    Attributes:
        time (int): UNIX timestamp in seconds representing the data point time.
            This value is automatically normalized during initialization.
        open (float): Opening price for the time period. Must be non-negative.
        high (float): Highest price during the time period. Must be >= low and non-negative.
        low (float): Lowest price during the time period. Must be <= high and non-negative.
        close (float): Closing price for the time period. Must be non-negative.

    Class Attributes:
        REQUIRED_COLUMNS (set): Set containing "open", "high", "low", and "close"
            as required columns for DataFrame conversion operations.
        OPTIONAL_COLUMNS (set): Empty set indicating no optional columns
            are available for this data type.

    Example:
        ```python
        from lightweight_charts_pro.data import OhlcData

        # Create OHLC data point
        data = OhlcData(time="2024-01-01T00:00:00", open=100.0, high=105.0, low=98.0, close=102.0)

        # Serialize for frontend
        serialized = data.asdict()
        ```

    Raises:
        ValueValidationError: If high < low (invalid OHLC relationship).
        NonNegativeValueError: If any OHLC value is negative.
        RequiredFieldError: If any required OHLC field is None or missing.

    See Also:
        Data: Base class providing time normalization and serialization.
        OhlcvData: OHLC data with additional volume information.
        CandlestickData: Specialized OHLC data for candlestick charts.

        This method is automatically called after the dataclass is initialized.
        It performs the following operations:
        1. Calls the parent class __post_init__ to normalize the time value
        2. Validates OHLC relationships (high must be >= low)
        3. Validates that all values are non-negative
        4. Handles NaN values by converting them to 0.0
        5. Validates that all required fields are present and not None

        The method ensures that all OHLC data points have valid relationships
        and non-NaN values that can be safely serialized and transmitted to the frontend.
