# MolSelector

MolSelector is a lightweight web app for triaging molecular structures (`.xyz`, `.mol`, `.mol2`). Point the app at a folder of files, explore each molecule in an interactive 3D viewer powered by [3Dmol.js](https://3dmol.csb.pitt.edu/), and rapidly tag it as **accept** or **decline**. Decisions are written to `selection_results.csv` in the chosen folder so they can be versioned or analyzed later.

## Requirements

- Python 3.12+
- A modern browser with WebGL support (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

## Installation

```bash
pip install molselector
```

## Running the app

Start a local server with the built-in CLI:

```bash
molselector launch
```

Open your browser to `http://127.0.0.1:8000` and MolSelector will be ready. The CLI exposes options such as `--host`, `--port`, and `--log-level`; use `molselector launch --help` to view them. You can still start the app manually with `uvicorn molselector.app:app` if you prefer.

To preload a folder of molecules (skipping the manual selection step), supply the `--xyz-folder` option:

```bash
molselector launch --xyz-folder /path/to/molecules
```

## Usage

### Keyboard shortcuts

- `Enter`, `A`, or `→`: accept the current molecule
- `D` or `←`: decline the current molecule
- `Backspace`, `B`, or `↑`: go back to the previous molecule

### Output format

The CSV file (`selection_results.csv`) contains three columns:

| column | description |
| --- | --- |
| `file` | Relative path to the molecule inside the selected folder |
| `decision` | Either `accept` or `decline` |
| `timestamp` | UTC timestamp recorded at the decision moment |
