A command-line wrapper for the the `mpv` video player to create bookmarks in videos and audio files from te command-line. This can be useful when clipping videos for memes.

This is lightweight and easy to edit. The timestamps obtained may be used with [ffmpeg](https://github.com/talwrii/ffmpeg-cookbook).

Mostly vibe-coded at present! I can code, quantity of vibe coding will likely decrease over time.

## Motivation
I quite like the command-line, and use it when I am not doing someting big. I wanted to cut out clips from a video from the command-line in order to share memes, but most of the tools were fiddley. So I decided to write this.

## Alternatives and prior work
mplayer and mpv support scripting and you may be able to define a bookmarks system for them. This seemed too fiddle for my liking.

Video editors like [[Shotcut]] may be useful for this sort of thing. If you are posting on youtube or TikTok the short creators allow some good editing.

You could use `vlc` to get these timestamps.

## Installation
Ensure mpv is installed:

```
sudo apt install mpv
```

You can then install `video-bookmarks` using [pipx](https://github.com/pypa/pipx):

```
pipx install video-bookmarks
```


# Usage
You can run `video-bookmarks test.mp4`. This then gives you a list of keybindings to run.

It will generate a bookmarks file called test.bookmarks.
