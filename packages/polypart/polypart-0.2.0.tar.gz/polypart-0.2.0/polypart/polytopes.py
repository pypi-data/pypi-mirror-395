    """
    Approximate the zero cell of a stationary isotropic Poisson hyperplane
    tessellation in R^d, by restricting to hyperplanes intersecting a ball
    of radius `window_radius` and keeping the cell containing the origin.

    Model:
        - Hyperplanes: { x : <u, x> = t }.
        - Directions u: isotropic on S^{d-1} (via normalised Gaussian).
        - Signed distances t | {hyperplane hits B(0, R)} ~ Uniform[-R, R].
        - Number N of such hyperplanes is Poisson with mean
              lambda_window = c * intensity * R
          where c>0 is an arbitrary constant absorbed into 'intensity'.
          Here we set lambda_window = 2 * intensity * R.

    Construction:
        - Sample N hyperplanes intersecting B(0, R).
        - For each, orient the halfspace so that it contains the origin.
        - Intersect all oriented halfspaces to obtain a polytope Q.
        - Reject if Q is infeasible or unbounded; otherwise return Q.

    As window_radius -> infinity, this converges (in law) to the true Poisson
    hyperplane zero cell, provided intensity and directional distribution are
    kept fixed.
