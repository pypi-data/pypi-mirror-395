## Overview

CALT is a simple Python library for learning arithmetic and symbolic computation with a Transformer model (a deep neural model to realize sequence-to-sequence functions). 

It offers a basic Transformer model and training, and non-experts of deep learning (e.g., mathematicians) can focus on constructing datasets to train and evaluate the model. Particularly, users only need to implement an instance generator for their own task.

For example, users define the following code for the polynomial addition task.

```python
class SumProblemGenerator:
    # Task - input: F=[f_1, ..., f_s], target: G=[g:= f_1+...+f_s]
    def __init__(
        self, sampler: PolynomialSampler, max_polynomials: int, min_polynomials: int
    ):
        self.sampler = sampler
        self.max_polynomials = max_polynomials  
        self.min_polynomials = min_polynomials

    def __call__(self, seed: int) -> Tuple[List[PolyElement], PolyElement]:
        random.seed(seed) # Set random seed
        num_polys = random.randint(self.min_polynomials, self.max_polynomials) 

        F = self.sampler.sample(num_samples=num_polys)
        g = sum(F)

        return F, g
```

CALT automatically calls this generator in parallel to efficiently construct large datasets and trains a Transformer model to learn the computation. The sample generation process itself can reveal unexplored mathematical problems, enabling researchers to study their theoretical and algorithmic solutions. The following is a small list of such studies from our group.
