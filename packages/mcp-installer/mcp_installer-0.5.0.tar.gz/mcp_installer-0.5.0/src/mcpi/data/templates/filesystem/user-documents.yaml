notes: |
  This template provides access to your Documents directory.

  Security considerations:
    - ⚠️  Broader access than project-specific templates
    - ⚠️  AI can read/write all files in Documents
    - ✓  More convenient for working with multiple projects
    - ✓  Still safer than full home directory access

  Common Documents paths by platform:
    - macOS: /Users/username/Documents
    - Linux: /home/username/Documents
    - Windows: C:\Users\username\Documents

  You can use tilde (~) for home directory:
    - ~/Documents (expands to your home directory)

  What the AI can do:
    - Read all files in your Documents directory
    - Write/edit files anywhere in Documents
    - Create/delete files and folders
    - Navigate all subdirectories in Documents

  What the AI cannot do:
    - Access files outside Documents
    - Access system files
    - Access other users' files

  Use cases:
    - Working across multiple projects in Documents
    - Managing personal writing and notes
    - Organizing documents and files

  Alternative: Consider using project-specific templates for
  better security isolation when working on individual projects.
