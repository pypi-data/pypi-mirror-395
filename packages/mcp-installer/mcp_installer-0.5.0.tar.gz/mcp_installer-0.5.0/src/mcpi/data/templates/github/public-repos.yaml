notes: |
  This template provides minimal permissions for public repositories only.

  To create a public-only Personal Access Token:
    1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
    2. Click "Generate new token" → "Generate new token (classic)"
    3. Give it a descriptive name (e.g., "MCP Public Repos")
    4. Select only one scope:
       - ✓ public_repo (Access public repositories)
    5. Click "Generate token" and copy it immediately

  What you CAN do:
    - Read public repositories
    - Browse code in public repos
    - Read public issues and pull requests
    - View public repository information

  What you CANNOT do:
    - Access private repositories
    - Access organization information
    - Create/modify/delete anything
    - Fork repositories
    - Create issues or pull requests

  Comparison with other GitHub templates:
    - personal-full-access: Full control of private + public repos
    - read-only: Read access to public repos + org info
    - public-repos (this): Minimal access to public repos only

  Security benefits:
    - Most restrictive GitHub template
    - Safe for public code exploration
    - No access to private data
    - No write permissions at all
    - Minimal risk if token is compromised

  Use cases:
    - Exploring open source projects
    - Learning from public code
    - Contributing to public repos (read-only research)
    - Maximum security with minimal permissions

  Note: For contributing to open source (creating PRs), you'll need
  at least 'public_repo' with write access or the 'repo' scope.
  This template is strictly read-only for exploration.
