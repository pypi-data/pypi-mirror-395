notes: |
  This template creates a Slack bot with access to specific channels only.

  To set up a Slack bot (same as bot-token template):
    1. Go to: https://api.slack.com/apps
    2. Create a new app or select existing one
    3. Add Bot Token Scopes:
       - channels:history, channels:read, chat:write
       - reactions:write, users:read, users.profile:read
    4. Install to workspace and copy Bot Token (xoxb-...)

  To find Channel IDs:
    Method 1 - From Slack client:
      1. Open the channel in Slack
      2. Click the channel name at the top
      3. Scroll down in the About tab
      4. The Channel ID is shown (starts with C)

    Method 2 - From URL:
      1. Open the channel in web browser
      2. The URL contains the channel ID:
         https://app.slack.com/client/T.../C01234567
                                              ^^^^^^^^^ channel ID

  Channel ID format:
    - Public channels: C01234567
    - Private channels: G01234567
    - DMs: D01234567

  Multiple channels:
    - Separate with commas (no spaces)
    - Example: C01234567,C76543210,C11111111

  Security benefits:
    - Bot can only access specified channels
    - Prevents access to sensitive channels
    - Good for departmental or project-specific bots
    - Reduces risk of information leakage

  Use cases:
    - Bot for specific project channels only
    - Department-specific automation
    - Testing in controlled channels
    - Compliance and data security requirements

  Note: The bot must still be invited to each channel to interact with it.
