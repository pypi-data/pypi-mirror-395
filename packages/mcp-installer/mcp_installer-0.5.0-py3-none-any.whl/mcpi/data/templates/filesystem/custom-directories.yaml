notes: |
  This template allows access to multiple custom directories.

  Security considerations:
    - ⚠️  More complex access control
    - ⚠️  AI can access all specified directories
    - ⚠️  Carefully consider which directories to include
    - ✓  More flexible than single-directory templates
    - ✓  Good for multi-project workflows

  Path requirements:
    - Must be absolute paths (start with / or ~/)
    - Tilde (~) expands to your home directory
    - Paths are validated but may not exist yet

  Example use cases:
    - Multiple project directories:
        /Users/username/work/project1
        /Users/username/work/project2
        /Users/username/personal/blog

    - Separate code and documents:
        ~/Code
        ~/Documents/specs
        ~/Desktop/notes

    - Development and testing:
        /var/www/dev
        /var/www/staging
        /var/log/app

  Implementation note:
    The filesystem server accepts multiple directory arguments.
    When this template is processed, all non-empty directory paths
    will be added to the server's args array.

  What the AI can do:
    - Read/write files in any specified directory
    - Navigate all subdirectories
    - Create/delete files and folders
    - Full access within each directory

  What the AI cannot do:
    - Access directories not specified
    - Access parent directories
    - Access system files outside allowed paths

  Best practices:
    - Only include directories you trust the AI to access
    - Use project-specific templates when possible
    - Consider separate templates for different use cases
    - Document why each directory is included

  Alternative templates:
    - project-files: Single project directory (safest)
    - user-documents: Standard Documents directory
    - custom-directories (this): Multiple directories (most flexible)
