  This template provides read-only access to GitHub repositories.

  To create a read-only Personal Access Token:
    1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
    2. Click "Generate new token" → "Generate new token (classic)"
    3. Give it a descriptive name (e.g., "MCP Read-Only Access")

       - ✓ public_repo (Access public repositories)
       - ✓ read:org (Read org and team membership)
    5. Click "Generate token" and copy it immediately

  What you CAN do with read-only access:
    - Browse code in public repositories
    - Read issues and pull requests
    - View repository information

  What you CANNOT do:
    - Modify files or create commits
    - Create/update/delete issues or PRs
    - Fork repositories
    - Modify repository settings
    - Write to any repository

  Security benefits:
    - Limits potential damage if token is compromised
    - Safe for code browsing and research
    - Good for learning and exploration
    - Prevents accidental modifications

  Use case: When you want to browse code and issues without risk of
  accidentally modifying repositories.
