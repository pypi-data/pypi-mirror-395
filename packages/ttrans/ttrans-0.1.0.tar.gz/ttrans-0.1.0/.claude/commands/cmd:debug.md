# Debug Investigation

Investigate issues without burning main context. Uses parallel Task agents to gather evidence while preserving your working context.

Issue context: $ARGUMENTS

## Process

### 1. Understand the Issue

Parse the provided context:
- Error messages or symptoms
- Affected components
- Recent changes
- Steps to reproduce (if known)

### 2. Launch Parallel Investigations

Spawn Task agents with `subagent_type=debugger` to investigate different aspects concurrently:

**Agent 1: Recent Changes**
```
Investigate recent git changes that might relate to [issue].
- Check git log for relevant commits
- Look for changes to affected files
- Identify when issue might have been introduced
Return: Timeline of relevant changes with file:line references
```

**Agent 2: Code Analysis**
```
Analyze the code paths related to [issue].
- Trace execution flow
- Identify potential failure points
- Look for error handling gaps
Return: Code analysis with specific file:line references
```

**Agent 3: Configuration/Environment**
```
Check configuration and environment factors.
- Look for relevant config files
- Check for environment variable usage
- Identify external dependencies
Return: Configuration findings relevant to the issue
```

**Agent 4: Test Coverage** (if applicable)
```
Check test coverage for affected code.
- Find existing tests for the component
- Identify gaps in test coverage
- Look for failing tests
Return: Test analysis with file:line references
```

### 3. Gather Additional Evidence

If applicable, run commands to gather more context:

```bash
# Check recent logs (if log files exist)
# Check git status
git status
git log --oneline -10

# Check for error patterns
# (grep for error messages in codebase)
```

### 4. Synthesize Findings

Wait for all agents to complete, then compile:
- Root cause hypothesis
- Evidence supporting hypothesis
- Related code paths
- Potential fixes

### 5. Generate Debug Report

Create document at: `thoughts/debug/YYYY-MM-DD-description.md`

- Risk: [Assessment]

### Option 2: [Fix Title]

## Blockers

[If investigation is blocked, list what's needed]
- Need access to: [resource]
- Need user to: [action]

## Next Steps

- Key evidence
- Recommended fixes with risk assessment
- Any blockers requiring user input

## Guidelines

- Use parallel Task agents to preserve main context
- Focus on gathering evidence, not making changes
- Return specific file:line references
- Present hypotheses with confidence levels
- Identify blockers that need user input
