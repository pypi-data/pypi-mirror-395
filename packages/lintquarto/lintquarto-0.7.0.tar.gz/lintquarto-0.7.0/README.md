**Package for running linters, static type checkers and code analysis tools on python code in quarto (`.qmd`) files.**

By default, python code validation tools can't check embedded python code in Quarto files. This package fills that gap, enabling analysts and researchers to run python quality checks within Quarto documents.

Currently supported:

* Linters: [pylint](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint), [flake8](https://github.com/pycqa/flake8), [pydoclint](https://github.com/jsh9/pydoclint), [pyflakes](https://github.com/PyCQA/pyflakes), [ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff), [vulture](https://github.com/jendrikseipp/vulture), and [pycodestyle](https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle).
* Static type checkers: [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy), [pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright), [pyrefly](https://github.com/facebook/pyrefly), and [pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype).
* Code analysis tools: [radon](https://github.com/rubik/radon).

## Installation

You can install **lintquarto** with pip ([from PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/lintquarto/)) or conda ([from conda-forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/lintquarto)).

### Install with pip

```
pip install lintquarto
```

To include your selection of linters, install them as needed.

For a one-step installation that includes lintquarto and all supported linters and type checkers, use:

```
pip install lintquarto[all]
```

### Install with conda

```
conda install conda-forge::lintquarto
```

With conda, only the main lintquarto tool is installed. If you want to use any linters or type checkers, you must install them separately (either with conda or pip, depending on availability).

## Getting started using `lintquarto`

### Usage

Usage:

```
lintquarto -l LINTER [LINTER ...] -p PATH [PATH ...] [-e EXCLUDE [EXCLUDE ...]] [-k]
```

Options:

* `-l, --linters LINTER [LINTER ...]` - linters to run.
* `-p, --paths PATH [PATH ...]` - quarto files and/or directories to include.
* `-e, --exclude EXCLUDE [EXCLUDE ...]` - optional, files and/or directories to exclude.
* `-k, --keep-temp` - optional, keep temporary `.py` files created during linting (for debugging).

Passing extra arguments directly to linters is not supported. Only `.qmd` files are processed.

### Examples

The linter used is interchangeable in these examples.

Lint all `.qmd` files in the current directory (using `pylint`):

```{.bash}
lintquarto -l pylint -p .
```

Lint several specific files (using `pylint` and `flake8`):

```{.bash}
lintquarto -l pylint flake8 -p file1.qmd file2.qmd
```

Keep temporary `.py` files after linting (with `pylint`)

```{.bash}
lintquarto -l pylint -p . -k
```

Lint all files in current directory (using `ruff`):

* Excluding folders `examples/` and `ignore/`, or-
* Excluding a specific file `analysis/test.qmd`.

```{.bash}
lintquarto -l ruff -p . -e examples ignore
```

```{.bash}
lintquarto -l ruff -p . -e analysis/test.qmd
```
