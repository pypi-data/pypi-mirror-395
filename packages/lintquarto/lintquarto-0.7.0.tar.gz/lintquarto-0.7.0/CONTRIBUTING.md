## Workflow for bug reports, feature requests and documentation improvements

Before opening an issue, please search [existing issues](https://github.com/lintquarto/lintquarto/issues/) to avoid duplicates. If an issue exists, you can add a comment with additional details and/or upvote (👍) the issue. If there is not an existing issue, please open one and provide as much detail as possible.

* **For feature requests or documentation improvements**, please describe your suggestion clearly.
* **For bugs**, include:
    * Steps to reproduce.
    * Expected and actual behaviour.
    * Environment details (operating system, python version, dependencies).
    * Relevant files (e.g. problematic `.qmd` files).

### Handling bug reports (for maintainers):

* Confirm reproducibility by following the reported steps.
* Label the issue appropriately (e.g. `bug`).
* Request additional information if necessary.
* Link related issues or pull requests.
* Once resolved, close the issue with a brief summary of the fix.

<br>

## Workflow for code contributions (bug fixes, enhancements)

1. Fork the repository and clone your fork.

2. Create a new branch for your feature or fix:

```{.bash}
git checkout -b my-feature
```

3. Make your changes and commit them with clear, descriptive messages using the [conventional commits standard](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

4. Push your branch to your fork:

```{.bash}
git push origin my-feature
```

5. Open a pull request against the main branch. Describe your changes and reference any related issues.

## Development and testing

### Dependencies

If you want to contribute to `lintquarto` or run its tests, you'll need some additional tools:

| Tool | Purpose |
| - | - |
| **check-dependencies** | Test for undeclared dependencies |
| **flit** | Packaging and publishing |
| **genbadge** | Create coverage badge (README) |
| **grayskull** | Uploading to `conda-forge` |
| **jupyter** | Run python code in docs |
| **pre-commit** | To make pre-commit hook that lints files |
| **pytest** | Run tests |
| **pytest-cov** | Calculate coverage |
| **twine** | Upload to PyPI |
| **types-toml** | Required by `mypy` |
| **quartodoc** | Generate API docs |
| `-e .[all]` | Editable install + all linters |

These are listed in `requirements-dev.txt` for convenience. To set up your development environment, create an environment (e.g. `virtualenv`) and run:

```{.bash}
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

For testing only (used by GitHub actions):

```{.bash}
pip install -r requirements-test.txt
```

You can also install the packages in `requirements-dev.txt` when you install `lintquarto` by running:

```{.bash}
pip install lintquarto[dev]
```

Quarto (used for the docs) is a standalone tool - install it from https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/.

<br>

### Dependency versions

Contributors are encouraged to install and use the **latest versions** of development tools. This helps keep the project compatible with current tooling and catches issues early.

If you need a fully reproducible and stable setup, use the provided Conda environment file. This file pins all development tool versions, including Python:

```{.bash}
conda env create -f requirements-stable.yml
```

To update the stable environment, run `conda update --all` and test thoroughly (running tests, building documentation), and then update `requirements-stable.yml` with any changes.

<br>

### Docstrings

We follow the [numpydoc](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html) style for docstrings, and check these using [pydoclint](https://github.com/jsh9/pydoclint).

<br>

### Tests

Run all tests (with coverage):

```{.bash}
pytest --cov
```

Run an individual test file:

```{.bash}
pytest tests/test_back.py
```

Run a specific test:

```{.bash}
pytest tests/test_linters.py::test_supported_error
```

<br>

### Linting

Make scripts executable (first time only):

```{.bash}
chmod +x lint_package.sh
chmod +x lint_docs.sh
```

Lint the package:

```{.bash}
lint_package.sh
```

Lint the documentation:

```{.bash}
lint_docs.sh
```

There is a pre-commit hook provided which will lint the package and documentation with every commit. To make it executable, run:

```{.bash}
pre-commit install
```

**Not running in the right environment?** You may find the pre-commit fails if it is using the wrong environment - I've found this to be the case in VSCode. I've found the simplest way to fix this is to work on the command line, activate the environment, and then either do the commit directly there (i.e., `git add`, `git commit`) or launch VS Code (`code .`) which ensures it inherits the environment.

**Unstaged files detected** If you see `[WARNING] Unstaged files detected` during commit, this is normal; pre-commit is just temporarily saving your unstaged changes. The real blocker is any "linting failed" message or linter error output that follows—fix those errors in the listed files, re-stage, and commit again! *This message can occur when there are linting issues in your staged files when trying to commit, but you also have some unstaged files present. With no unstaged files present, message will be like `Git: Lint Package...... failed`*.

<br>

### Documentation

Build and preview the documentation locally:

```{.bash}
make -C docs
```

When running this, function documentation will be automatically generated from the codebase using `quartodoc`

<br>

## Updating the package

### Preparation

Before proceeding, you will need to have cloned the `lintquarto/staged-recipes` repository which is used to push updates to conda.

```{.bash}
git clone https://github.com/lintquarto/staged-recipes
```

### Workflow for updates

If you are a maintainer and need to publish a new release:

1. Update the `CHANGELOG.md`.

2. Update the version number in `__init__.py`, `CITATION.cff` and `README.md` citation, and update the date in `CITATION.cff`.

3. Create a release on GitHub, which will automatically archive to Zenodo.

4. Build and publish using flit or twine.

To upload to PyPI using `flit`:

```{.bash}
flit publish
```

To upload to PyPI using `twine`: remove any existing builds, then build the package locally and push with twine, entering the API token when prompted:

```{.bash}
rm -rf dist/
flit build
twine upload --repository pypi dist/*
```

For test runs, you can use the same method with test PyPI:

```{.bash}
rm -rf dist/
flit build
twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*
```

5. If you haven't already, fork the lintquarto feedstock ([conda-forge/lintquarto-feedstock](https://github.com/conda-forge/lintquarto-feedstock)). This fork must be to your personal GitHub account and not an organisation account. Clone it to your local machine.

If you already have a fork, make sure it is up-to-date:

* With the `conda-forge` feedstock - on your forked `main` branch, click "🔄 Sync fork".
* Locally on your `main` branch (`git checkout main`), run `git pull`.

6. Create and checkout a branch - e.g. `update_0_5_0`.

```{.bash}
git checkout -b update_0_5_0
```

7. Use `grayskull` to update the recipe (`recipe/meta.yaml`). It will pull the metadata about the package from PyPI, and will not use your local installation of the package.

```{.bash}
grayskull pypi lintquarto
```

It will create `lintquarto/meta.yaml`. You will need to copy over the contents into `recipe/meta.yaml`. When you do so, make sure to keep the two fixes made to the `meta.yaml` file which are...

Fix A: The addition of a `home` element within `about`.

```{.bash}
home: https://lintquarto.github.io/lintquarto/
```

Fix B: Correct python version requirements syntax as per the [conda-forge documentation](https://conda-forge.org/docs/maintainer/knowledge_base/#noarch-python), using `python_min` for `host` (fixed version), `run` (minimum version) and `requires` (fixed version).

**Note:** Don't need to set the `python_min` anywhere unless it differs from conda default (currently 3.7).

```{.bash}
  host:
    - python {{ python_min }}

...

  run:
    - python >={{ python_min }}

...

  requires:
    - python {{ python_min }}

```

7. Create a commit with the updated feedstock - for example:

```{.bash}
git add --all
git commit -m "updated feedstock to version 0.5.0"
git push
```

8. Use the GitHub website to open a pull request. Completed the provided checklist -

* Personal account? Yes, if you used your GitHub and not an organisation.
* Bump? Not relevant as doing a version update, can remove.
* Reset base? Yes, should show as `number: 0` in `meta.yaml` by default.
* Re-render? Add the command `@conda-forge-admin, please rerender` to the end of the pull request.

9. Wait for the CI actions to run. If all pass, then you can click "Merge pull request".
