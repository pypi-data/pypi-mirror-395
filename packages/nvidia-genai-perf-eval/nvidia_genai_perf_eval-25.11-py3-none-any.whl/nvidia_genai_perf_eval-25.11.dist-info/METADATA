                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or

              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,

              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# NVIDIA NeMo Evaluator

The goal of NVIDIA NeMo Evaluator is to advance and refine state-of-the-art methodologies for model evaluation, and deliver them as modular evaluation packages (evaluation containers and pip wheels) that teams can use as standardized building blocks.

# Quick start guide

NVIDIA NeMo Evaluator provide you with evaluation clients, that are specifically built to evaluate model endpoints using our Standard API.

## Launching an evaluation for an LLM

1. Install nemo-evaluator
    ```
    pip install nemo-evaluator
    ```

2. Install the package
    ```
    pip install nvidia-genai-perf-eval --index-url https://gitlab-master.nvidia.com/api/v4/projects/153108/packages/pypi/simple    
    ```

3. (Optional) Set a token to your API endpoint if it's protected
    ```bash
    export MY_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
    ```

4. List the available evaluations:
    ```bash
    $ nemo-evaluator ls
      Available tasks:
      * genai_perf_generation (in genai_perf_eval)
      * genai_perf_summarization (in genai_perf_eval)
    ...

    ```

5. Run the evaluation. Remember to set the tokenizer:
    ```bash
    nemo-evaluator run_eval \
       --eval_type genai_perf_generation \
       --model_id meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct \
       --model_url https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1/chat/completions \
       --model_type chat \
       --api_key_name MY_API_KEY \
       --output_dir /workspace/results \
       --overrides="config.params.extra.tokenizer=meta-llama/Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct,target.api_endpoint.stream=true"
    ```

    **It is recommended to turn the streaming on if your endpoint supports it (`target.api_endpoint.stream=true`).**
    Otherwise only a subset of metrics can be calculated.

    If your tokenizer comes from a gated repofitory (like in the example above), you will need to set the HF_TOKEN to authenticate before running the evaluation:
    
    ```bash
    export HF_TOKEN=...
    ```

6. Gather the results
    ```bash
    cat /workspace/results/results.yml
    ```

# Command-Line Tool

Each package comes pre-installed with a set of command-line tools, designed to simplify the execution of evaluation tasks. Below are the available commands and their usage for the `genai_perf_eval`:

## Commands

### 1. **List Evaluation Types**

```bash
nemo-evaluator ls
```

Displays the evaluation types available within the harness.

### 2. **Run an evaluation**

The `nemo-evaluator run_eval` command executes the evaluation process. Below are the flags and their descriptions:

### Required flags
* `--eval_type <string>`
The type of evaluation to perform
* `--model_id <string>`
The name or identifier of the model to evaluate.
* `--model_url <url>`
The API endpoint where the model is accessible.
* `--model_type <string>`
The type of the model to evaluate, currently either "chat", "completions", or "vlm".
* `--output_dir <directory>`
The directory to use as the working directory for the evaluation. The results, including the results.yml output file, will be saved here. Make sure to use the absolute path.
* `--overrides="config.params.extra.tokenizer=<tokenizer>"`
The name of the HuggingFace tokenizer used for evaluation (e.g. `meta-llama/Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct`). If it comes from a gated repository, you will need to export `HF_TOKEN=...` to authenticate.

### Optional flags
* `--api_key_name <string>`
The name of the environment variable that stores the Bearer token for the API, if authentication is required.
* `--run_config <path>`
Specifies the path to a  YAML file containing the evaluation definition.

### Example

```bash
export HF_TOKEN=...

nemo-evaluator run_eval \
    --eval_type genai_perf_generation \
    --model_id my_model \
    --model_type chat \
    --model_url http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions \
    --output_dir /workspace/evaluation_results \
    --overrides="config.params.extra.tokenizer=meta-llama/Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct,target.api_endpoint.stream=true"
```

If the model API requires authentication, set the API key in an environment variable and reference it using the `--api_key_name` flag:

```bash
export MY_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
export HF_TOKEN=...

nemo-evaluator run_eval \
    --eval_type genai_perf_generation \
    --model_id my_model \
    --model_type chat \
    --model_url http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions \
    --api_key_name MY_API_KEY \
    --output_dir /workspace/evaluation_results \
    --overrides="config.params.extra.tokenizer=meta-llama/Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct,target.api_endpoint.stream=true"
```

# Configuring evaluations via YAML

Evaluations in NVIDIA NeMo Evaluator are configured using YAML files that define the parameters and settings required for the evaluation process. These configuration files follow a standard API which ensures consistency across evaluations.

Example of a YAML config:
```yaml
config:
  type: genai_perf_generation
  params:
    parallelism: 50
    limit_samples: 20
    extra:
        tokenizer: microsoft/Phi-4-mini-instruct
target:
  api_endpoint:
    model_id: microsoft/phi-4-mini-instruct
    type: chat
    url: https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1/chat/completions
    api_key: NVIDIA_API_KEY
    stream: true
```

The priority of overrides is as follows:
1. command line arguments
2. user config (as seen above)
3. task defaults (defined per task type)
4. framework defaults 

`--dry_run` option allows you to print the final run configuration and command without executing the evaluation.

### Example:

```bash
nemo-evaluator run_eval \
    --eval_type genai_perf_generation \
    --model_id my_model \
    --model_type chat \
    --model_url http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions \
    --output_dir /workspace/evaluation_results \
    --overrides="config.params.extra.tokenizer=meta-llama/Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct" \
    --dry_run
```

Output:

```bash
Rendered config:

command: genai_perf_eval --model_id {{target.api_endpoint.model_id}} --url {{target.api_endpoint.url}}  {%
  if target.api_endpoint.api_key is not none %}--api-key {{target.api_endpoint.api_key}}
  {% endif %} --concurrencies {{config.params.parallelism}} --isl {{config.params.extra.isl}}
  --osl {{config.params.extra.osl}}  --tokenizer {{config.params.extra.tokenizer}}
  --endpoint-type {{target.api_endpoint.type}} --artifact-dir {{config.output_dir}}
  {% if target.api_endpoint.stream %}--streaming {% endif %}{% if config.params.extra.warmup
  %}--warmup{% endif %}

```

## Customizing your evaluation

## Running GenAI-Perf tasks with different values of ISL and OSL parameters

By default, `nemo-evaluator` supports two tasks: `genai_perf_summarization` and `genai_perf_generation`. The `genai_perf_summarization` task uses an input sequence length (`isl`) of 5000 tokens and an output sequence length (`osl`) of 500 tokens, testing how your endpoint handles tasks with long input and shorter output (e.g. summarizing a long text). The `genai_perf_generation` task uses an `isl` of 500 tokens and an `osl` of 5000 tokens, testing how your endpoint handles tasks with short input and long output (e.g. generating a long text based on a short prompt).

You can run an evaluation with your own set of parameters as follows:

1. Using the command-line tool:

    ```bash
    nemo-evaluator run_eval \
        --eval_type genai_perf_generation \
        --model_id my_model \
        --model_type chat \
        --model_url http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions \
        --api_key_name MY_API_KEY \
        --output_dir /workspace/evaluation_results \
        --overrides="config.params.extra.tokenizer=meta-llama/Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct,config.params.extra.isl=<your_isl_value>,config.params.extra.osl=<your_osl_value>"
    ```

2. Using a config file:

    ```bash
    config:
      type: genai_perf_generation
      params:
        parallelism: 1
        extra:
          isl: <your_isl_value>
          osl: <your_osl_value>
          tokenizer: meta-llama/Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct
    target:
      api_endpoint:
        url: http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions
        model_id: my_model
        type: chat
    ```

where `<your_isl_value>` and `<your_osl_value>` are your selected values of `isl` and `osl` parameters, respectively.
This allows you to test other common use-cases, e.g. for testing text generation speed you can set `isl=500` and `osl=5000`.

## Testing your endpoint with concurrent requests

By default, `nemo-evaluator` sends a single request at a time to your endpoint.
However, you can test how your endpoint handles traffic by setting the `parallelism` parameter to a higher value, e.g.:

1. Using the command-line tool:

    ```bash
    nemo-evaluator run_eval \
        --eval_type genai_perf_generation \
        --model_id my_model \
        --model_type chat \
        --model_url http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions \
        --api_key_name MY_API_KEY \
        --output_dir /workspace/evaluation_results \
        --overrides="config.params.extra.tokenizer=meta-llama/Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct,config.params.parallelism=<num_requests>"
    ```

2. Using a config file:

    ```bash
    config:
      type: genai_perf_generation
      params:
        parallelism: <num_requests>
        extra:
          tokenizer: meta-llama/Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct
    target:
      api_endpoint:
        url: http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions
        model_id: my_model
        type: chat
    ```
where `<num_requests>` is the number of concurrent requests send to the model.

## Deploying a model as an endpoint

NVIDIA NeMo Evaluator utilize a client-server communication architecture to interact with the model. As a prerequisite, the **model must be deployed as an endpoint with a NIM-compatible API**.

Users have the flexibility to deploy their model using their own infrastructure and tooling.

Servers with APIs that conform to the OpenAI/NIM API standard are expected to work seamlessly out of the box.
