              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and

                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or

              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

## Installation

Using uv (recommended):

```bash
uv pip install cesiumjs-anywidget
```

Or for development:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Alex-PLACET/cesiumjs_anywidget.git
cd cesiumjs_anywidget
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Quick Start

```python
from cesiumjs_anywidget import CesiumWidget

# Create and display the widget
widget = CesiumWidget(height="700px")
widget
```

## Usage Examples

### Fly to a Location

```python
# Fly to New York City
widget.fly_to(latitude=40.7128, longitude=-74.0060, altitude=50000)

# Fly to Mount Everest
widget.fly_to(latitude=27.9881, longitude=86.9250, altitude=20000)
```

### Advanced Camera Control

```python
# Set camera with custom orientation
widget.set_view(
    latitude=40.7128, 
    longitude=-74.0060, 
    altitude=5000,
    heading=45.0,    # Rotate view 45 degrees
    pitch=-45.0,     # Look at angle instead of straight down
    roll=0.0
)
```

### Read Camera State

```python
# Camera position is synchronized bidirectionally
print(f"Latitude: {widget.latitude:.4f}°")
print(f"Longitude: {widget.longitude:.4f}°")
print(f"Altitude: {widget.altitude:.2f} meters")
```

### Visualize GeoJSON Data

```python
geojson_data = {
    "type": "FeatureCollection",
    "features": [
        {
            "type": "Feature",
            "geometry": {
                "type": "Point",
                "coordinates": [-74.0060, 40.7128]
            },
            "properties": {
                "name": "New York City"
            }
        }
    ]
}

widget.load_geojson(geojson_data)
```

### Visualize CZML Data

CZML (Cesium Language) is a JSON format for describing time-dynamic graphical scenes. It's particularly useful for animations and complex visualizations.

```python
# Simple CZML example - as Python list
czml_data = [
    {
        "id": "document",
        "name": "Simple CZML",
        "version": "1.0"
    },
    {
        "id": "point",
        "name": "Location",
        "position": {
            "cartographicDegrees": [-74.0060, 40.7128, 0]
        },
        "point": {
            "pixelSize": 10,
            "color": {
                "rgba": [255, 0, 0, 255]
            }
        }
    }
]

widget.load_czml(czml_data)
```

Or from a JSON string:

```python
import json

# CZML as JSON string
czml_json = json.dumps([
    {"id": "document", "version": "1.0"},
    {
        "id": "satellite",
        "position": {
            "cartographicDegrees": [-75, 40, 500000]
        },
        "point": {"pixelSize": 8, "color": {"rgba": [0, 255, 0, 255]}}
    }
])

widget.load_czml(czml_json)
```

You can use the [czml3](https://github.com/Stoops-ML/czml3) library to generate CZML more easily, then pass the output as a string or list.

### Configure Viewer Options

```python
# Create widget with custom configuration
widget = CesiumWidget(
    height="700px",
    enable_terrain=True,
    enable_lighting=True,
    show_timeline=True,
    show_animation=True,
    latitude=27.9881,
    longitude=86.9250,
    altitude=30000
)
```

## Development

Enable hot module replacement for live updates during development:

```bash
export ANYWIDGET_HMR=1
jupyter lab
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Install with dev dependencies
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=cesiumjs_anywidget --cov-report=html

# Or use make
make test
make test-cov
```

See [tests/README.md](tests/README.md) for detailed testing documentation.

## Measurement Tools

The widget includes built-in measurement tools for spatial analysis:

### Distance Measurement

Measure the distance between two points:

```python
# Enable distance measurement mode
widget.enable_measurement(mode="distance")

# Click two points in the viewer to measure distance
# Results are automatically synced to Python
measurements = widget.get_measurements()
print(f"Distance: {measurements[0]['value']:.2f} meters")
```

### Multi-Point Distance Measurement

Measure distances along a polyline with multiple points:

```python
# Enable multi-point distance measurement
widget.enable_measurement(mode="multi-distance")

# Click multiple points to create a polyline
# Right-click to finish the measurement
# Total distance is calculated automatically
```

### Height Measurement

Measure vertical height from ground to a point (useful for buildings):

```python
# Enable height measurement
widget.enable_measurement(mode="height")

# Click on a point to measure its height above ground
measurements = widget.get_measurements()
print(f"Height: {measurements[0]['value']:.2f} meters")
```

### Managing Measurements

```python
# Get all measurement results
measurements = widget.get_measurements()
for m in measurements:
    print(f"Type: {m['type']}, Value: {m['value']:.2f}m")

# Clear all measurements
widget.clear_measurements()

# Disable measurement mode
widget.disable_measurement()
```

### Loading Measurements from Python

You can programmatically add measurements with specific coordinates:

```python
# Load a distance measurement between two points
measurements_data = [
    {
        "type": "distance",
        "name": "Bridge Length",
        "points": [
            {"coordinates": [-74.0445, 40.6892, 10]},  # [lon, lat, alt]
            {"coordinates": [-73.9626, 40.8075, 10]}
        ]
    }
]
widget.load_measurements(measurements_data)

# Load an area measurement (polygon)
area_data = [
    {
        "type": "area",
        "name": "Central Park",
        "points": [
            {"coordinates": [-73.9812, 40.7681, 0]},
            {"coordinates": [-73.9581, 40.7681, 0]},
            {"coordinates": [-73.9581, 40.8005, 0]},
            {"coordinates": [-73.9812, 40.8005, 0]}
        ]
    }
]
widget.load_measurements(area_data)

# Focus camera on a specific measurement
widget.focus_on_measurement(0)  # Focus on first measurement
```

### Controlling Measurement UI Visibility

You can show/hide the measurement tools and list panel:

```python
# Hide measurement tools (toolbar)
widget.hide_tools()
# Or: widget.show_measurement_tools = False

# Show tools again
widget.show_tools()
# Or: widget.show_measurement_tools = True

# Hide the measurements list panel
widget.hide_list()
# Or: widget.show_measurements_list = False

# Show list again
widget.show_list()
# Or: widget.show_measurements_list = True

# Create a clean viewer without measurement tools
widget = CesiumWidget(
    show_measurement_tools=False,
    show_measurements_list=False
)
```

Each measurement includes:
- `type`: Measurement type (`'distance'`, `'multi-distance'`, `'height'`, or `'area'`)
- `value`: Measured value in meters (distance) or square meters (area)
- `points`: List of coordinates with `lat`, `lon`, `alt` properties
- `name`: Optional name for the measurement (auto-generated if not provided)

## Examples

See the [examples](examples/) directory for Jupyter notebook demonstrations.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with widget initialization:

```python
from cesiumjs_anywidget import CesiumWidget
widget = CesiumWidget()
widget.debug_info()  # Show debug information
```

Common fixes:
- **Open browser DevTools (F12)** and check the Console tab for errors
- Try without terrain: `widget = CesiumWidget(enable_terrain=False)`
- Ensure you're using JupyterLab 4.0+ or Jupyter Notebook 7.0+
- Check internet connection (CesiumJS loads from CDN)

See [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for detailed debugging guide.
