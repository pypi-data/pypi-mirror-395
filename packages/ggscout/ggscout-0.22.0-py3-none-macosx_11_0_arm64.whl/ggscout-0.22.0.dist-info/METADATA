# ggscout

**GitGuardian CLI tool for NHI (Non-Human Identity) discovery and remediation**

ggscout is a Rust-powered command-line tool by [GitGuardian](https://gitguardian.com) that discovers and inventories Non-Human Identities (NHIs) across your production infrastructure. NHIs include services, applications, containers, and automation scripts that authenticate and access resources without human intervention. ggscout maps these identities, their permissions, and associated secrets to help organizations understand their NHI landscape and bootstrap incident remediation.

## Installation

```bash
# Using uv (recommended)
uv tool install ggscout

# Using pip
pip install ggscout
```

*Note: This is a Rust binary packaged for distribution via PyPI*

## Basic Usage

```bash
# Display help
ggscout --help

# Fetch secrets from configuration
ggscout fetch config.toml

# Run with debug logging
ggscout --verbose DEBUG fetch config.toml
```

## Supported Platforms

ggscout inventories Non-Human Identities from:

- **HashiCorp Vault** - KV stores, dynamic secrets, auth methods
- **AWS Secrets Manager** - Secrets and associated IAM roles
- **Azure Key Vault** - Keys, secrets, and managed identities
- **Google Cloud Secret Manager** - Secrets and service accounts
- **Kubernetes/OpenShift** - Secrets, ConfigMaps, Deployments, ServiceAccounts, Environment Variables
- **Akeyless Vault** - Static and dynamic secrets
- **CyberArk SaaS / CyberArk Self-Hosted** - Application identities and secrets
- **Delinea Secret Server** - Machine accounts and credentials
- **GitLab CI** - Project variables and pipeline identities

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive NHI Discovery** - Inventories services, roles, and secrets across platforms
- **Production-ready** - Built for production environments with secure data handling
- **Multi-platform Support** - Works with major secret management and orchestration platforms
- **Secure Transfer** - Optional hashing before transmission to GitGuardian platform
- **High Performance** - Rust implementation optimized for large-scale inventories
- **Flexible Configuration** - TOML-based config with environment variable interpolation

## Configuration Example

```toml
[sources.vault]
type = "hashicorpvault"
vault_address = "${VAULT_ADDR}"

[sources.vault.auth]
auth_mode = "token"
token = "${VAULT_TOKEN}"

[sources.k8s]
type = "k8s"
kubeconfig_path = "~/.kube/config"
```
