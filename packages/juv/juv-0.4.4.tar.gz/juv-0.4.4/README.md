  </p>
</p>

- 🗂️ Create, manage, and run Jupyter notebooks with their dependencies
- 📌 Pin dependencies with [PEP 723 - inline script metadata](https://peps.python.org/pep-0723)
- 🚀 Launch ephemeral sessions for multiple front ends (e.g., JupyterLab, Notebook, NbClassic)
- ⚡ Powered by [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for fast dependency management

## Installation

**juv** is published to the Python Package Index (PyPI) and can be installed
globally with `uv` or `pipx` (recommended):

```sh
uv tool install juv
# or pipx install juv
```

You can also use the [`uvx`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/) command
to invoke it without installing:

```sh
uvx juv
```

## Usage

**juv** should feel familar for `uv` users. The goal is to extend its
dependencies management to Jupyter notebooks.

```sh
# Create a notebook
juv init notebook.ipynb
juv init --python=3.9 notebook.ipynb # specify a minimum Python version

# Add dependencies to the notebook
juv add notebook.ipynb pandas numpy
juv add notebook.ipynb --requirements=requirements.txt

# Pin a timestamp to constrain dependency resolution to a specific date
juv stamp notebook.ipynb # now

# Launch the notebook
juv run notebook.ipynb
juv run --with=polars notebook.ipynb # additional dependencies for this session (not saved)
juv run --jupyter=notebook@6.4.0 notebook.ipynb # pick a specific Jupyter frontend
juv run --jupyter=nbclassic notebook.ipynb -- --no-browser # pass additional arguments to Jupyter

# JUV_JUPYTER env var to set preferred Jupyter frontend (default: lab)
export JUV_JUPYTER=nbclassic
juv run notebook.ipynb

# Lock the dependencies of a notebook
# The lockfile is respected (and updated) when using `juv run`/`juv add`/`juv remove`
juv lock Untitled.ipynb
# Print the lockfile
cat Untitled.ipynb | jq -r '.metadata["uv.lock"]'

# See dependency tree of notebook
juv tree Untitled.ipynb

# Export a lockfile in a pip-compatable format
juv export Untitled.ipynb
```

If a script is provided to `run`, it will be converted to a notebook before
launching the Jupyter session.

```sh
uvx juv run script.py
# Converted script to notebook `script.ipynb`
# Launching Jupyter session...
```

### Exporting virtual environments

**juv** manages notebooks with dependencies and runs them in a Jupyter UI using
_ephemeral_ virtual environments. To make these environments available to other
tools, use `juv venv` to export a virtual environment with a kernel.

```sh
juv venv --from=Untitled.ipynb
# Using CPython 3.13.0
# Creating virtual environment at: .venv
# Activate with: source .venv/bin/activate
```

Most editors (e.g., VS Code) allow selecting this environment for running
notebooks and enabling features like autocomplete and type checking. To omit
adding `ipykernel` to the exported enviroment, you can add `--no-kernel` flag:

```sh
juv venv --from=Untitled.ipynb --no-kernel
```

> [!NOTE]
> We **do not** recommend modifying this environment directly (e.g., with `pip`
> or `uv`, see below). Instead, recreate it by running `juv venv` again
> whenever you update dependencies to keep it up to date.

### Other Jupyter front ends (e.g., VS Code)

**juv** has a [VS Code
extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=manzt.juv) that
provides a more integrated experience. Notebooks created with the `juv` CLI can
be run with the extension and vice versa.

## Motivation

_Rethinking the "getting started" guide for notebooks_

Jupyter notebooks are the de facto standard for data science, yet they suffer
from a [reproducibility
crisis](https://leomurta.github.io/papers/pimentel2019a.pdf).

This issue does not stem from a fundamental lack of care for reproducibility.
Rather, our tools limit us from easily falling into the [pit of
success](https://blog.codinghorror.com/falling-into-the-pit-of-success) with
notebooks - in particular, managing dependencies.

Notebooks are much like one-off Python scripts and therefore do not benefit
from the same dependency management as packages. Being a "good steward" of
notebooks requires discipline (due to the manual nature of virtual
environments) and knowledge of Python packaging - a somewhat unreasonable
expectation for domain experts who are focused on solving problems, not
software engineering.

You will often find a "getting started" guide in the wild like this:

```sh
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt # or just pip install pandas numpy, etc
jupyter lab
```

Four lines of code, where a few things can go wrong. _What version of Python?_
_What package version(s)?_ _What if we forget to activate the environment?_

The gold standard for "getting started" is a **single command** (i.e, no
guide).

```sh
<magic tool> run notebook.ipynb
```

However, this ideal has remained elusive for Jupyter notebooks. Why?

- **Virtual environments are a leaky abstraction** deeply ingrained in the
Python psyche: _create_, _activate_, _install_, _run_. Their historical "cost"
has forced us to treat them as entities that must be managed explicitly. In
fact, an entire ecosystem of tooling and best practices are oriented around
long-lived environments, rather than something more ephemeral. End users
separately _create_ and then _mutate_ virtual environments with low-level tools
like `pip`. The manual nature and overhead of these steps encourages sharing
environments across projects - a nightmare for reproducibility.

- **Only Python packages could historically specify their dependencies**. Data
science code often lives in notebooks rather than packages, with no way to
specify dependencies for standalone scripts without external files like
`requirements.txt`.

*Aligning of the stars*

Two key ideas have changed my perspective on this problem and inspired **juv**:

- **Virtual environments are now "cheap"**. A year ago, they were a necessary
evil. [uv](https://peps.python.org/pep-0723/) is such a departure from the
status quo that it forces us to rethink best practices. Environments are now
created faster than JupyterLab starts - why keep them around at all?

- **PEP 723**. [Inline script metadata](https://peps.python.org/pep-0723/)
introduces a standard for specifying dependencies for standalone Python
scripts. A single file can now contain everything needed to run it, without
relying on external files like `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`.

So, what if:

- _Environments were disposable by default?_
- _Notebooks could specify their own dependencies?_

This is the vision of **juv**

## How

[PEP 723 (inline script metadata)](https://peps.python.org/pep-0723) allows
specifying dependencies as comments within Python scripts, enabling
self-contained, reproducible execution. This feature could significantly
improve reproducibility in the data science ecosystem, since many analyses are
shared as standalone code (not packages). However, _a lot_ of data science code
lives in notebooks (`.ipynb` files), not Python scripts (`.py` files).

**juv** bridges this gap by:

- Extending PEP 723-style metadata support from `uv` to Jupyter notebooks
- Launching Jupyter sessions for various notebook front ends (e.g., JupyterLab, Notebook, NbClassic) with the specified dependencies

It's a simple Python script that parses the notebook and starts a Jupyter
session with the specified dependencies (piggybacking on `uv`'s existing
functionality).

## Alternatives

`juv` is opinionated and might not suit your preferences. That's ok! `uv` is
super extensible, and I recommend reading the wonderful
[documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv) to learn about its primitives.

For example, you can achieve a similar workflow using the `--with-requirements`
flag:

```sh
uvx --with-requirements=requirements.txt --from=jupyter-core --with=jupyterlab jupyter lab notebook.ipynb
```

While slightly more verbose and breaking self-containment, this approach
totally works and saves you from installing another dependency.

There is also an [experimental rewrite](https://github.com/manzt/juv-rs) in
Rust.
