## 🤔 Motivation

Some folks such as [Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/) have convinced me to start blogging my thoughts. I wanted to keep things simple—just a dumb set of markdown files should be enough to create a super simple HTML blog.

Even with great tools like [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/), [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), and [Pelican](https://getpelican.com/) available, they felt too complicated for what I needed. I wanted the minimal expression of simplicity. Hence, BlogTuner was born.

The idea is to keep your markdown files in a repo, generate HTML with BlogTuner, and deploy to a service like GitHub Pages. As simple as that.

## 📦 Installation

The recommended way to use BlogTuner is via `uvx` (by the way, if you haven't heard about `uv` you should [read about it](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)):

```bash
uvx blogtuner build source_dir target_dir
```

If you prefer to install it:

```bash
uv pip install blogtuner
```

You can use the traditional `pip` workflow without `uv` as well.

## 🚀 Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Create a new blog directory
mkdir myblog
cd myblog

# Create your first post
echo "# Hello World" > first-post.md

# Generate your blog
uvx blogtuner build . _site
```

### Post Management

BlogTuner comes with a set of commands to manage your posts:

```bash
# List all your posts
blogtuner post list

# Publish a draft post
blogtuner post publish slug-of-your-post

# Unpublish a post (mark as draft)
blogtuner post unpublish slug-of-your-post

# Delete a post
blogtuner post delete slug-of-your-post
```

### Importing Content

#### From Markdown Files

```bash
# Import a markdown file as a new post
blogtuner post import markdown /path/to/your/post.md
```

#### From Substack

```bash
# Import all posts from a Substack blog
blogtuner post import substack https://yourblog.substack.com
```

### Smart File Organization

BlogTuner automatically renames your files to follow the pattern `YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md`.

When BlogTuner normalizes your file names, it intelligently detects if the file is part of a Git repository:

- If the file is tracked in Git, it uses `git mv` to rename it, preserving your Git history
- If not, it falls back to a regular file system rename

This makes BlogTuner play nicely with your Git workflow while keeping everything organized.

### Images

BlogTuner automatically processes images for your posts:

1. Place an image with the same name as your post (e.g., `2024-04-05-my-post.jpg` for `2024-04-05-my-post.md`)
2. BlogTuner will automatically process it, create optimized WebP versions, and generate thumbnails
3. Images are referenced in your HTML and feed automatically

### Frontmatter

Posts can include TOML frontmatter at the beginning of the file (if you don't include it, it will be generated during the first run):

```markdown
+++
title = "My Awesome Post"
pubdate = "2024-04-05"
draft = false
slug = "custom-slug"  # Optional, defaults to filename
tags = ["tech", "programming"]
pinned = false  # Set to true to pin this post to the top
oneliner = "A brief description of this post"
description = "A longer description for SEO purposes"
original_href = "https://original-source.com/post"  # If republishing from elsewhere
+++

# My Awesome Post

Content goes here...
```

### Blog Configuration

Create a `blog.toml` in your source directory (it will be created on the first run if you're lazy like me):

```toml
name = "My Awesome Blog"
author = "Your Name"
base_url = "https://yourdomain.com"
base_path = "/"
lang = "en"
timezone = "UTC"
description = "A blog about interesting things"
footer_text = "Powered by <a href='https://github.com/alltuner/blogtuner'>BlogTuner</a>"
links = { "GitHub" = "https://github.com/yourusername", "Twitter" = "https://twitter.com/yourusername" }
twitter_metadata = { "site" = "@yoursite", "creator" = "@yourusername" }
```
