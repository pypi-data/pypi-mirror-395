The goal of this project is to create more minimal simulation environments for robotics training.

Existing solutions like [ROS 2](https://github.com/ros2) and [Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/) come with many heavy dependencies.

Additionally they are usually difficult to get setup and may require domain specific knowledge to use.
Simulation environments should be able to run in any notebook environment and require fewer dependencies.

Users can setup thier own environments and modify scenarios through a simple json schema.

## Get Started 🚀

```bash
pip install coderbot_sim
```
