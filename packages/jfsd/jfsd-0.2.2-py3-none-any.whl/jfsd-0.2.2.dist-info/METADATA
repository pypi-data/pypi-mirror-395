              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

# jfsd: a Python implementation of Fast Stokesian Dynamics with Jax

This repository contains a Python implementation of the Fast Stokesian Dynamics methods (A. Fiore, J. Swan, 2019, https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-fluid-mechanics/article/abs/fast-stokesian-dynamics/970BD1B80B43E21CD355C7BAD4644D46) which leverages the library JAX to just-in-time compile and run on GPU the simulation. The accuracy of hydrodynamic interactions can be scaled down in order to obtain Rotne-Prager-Yamakawa (up to 2-body effects, and no lubrication) or Brownian Dynamics (only 1-body effects). Boundary conditions can be switch from periodic to open, and the average height of asperities on particles can be specified, enabling simulations of rough colloids. 

## Installation Guide  

### Pre-requisites:  
- **CUDA** (tested with version **11.8**): [Download](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-11-8-0-download-archive)  
- **cuDNN** (tested with **8.6** for CUDA 11): [Download](https://developer.nvidia.com/rdp/cudnn-archive)  
- **Python** ≥ 3.9  

### Installation Options  

You can install **JFSD** in two ways:  

1. **Via pip (Stable Release)**:  
   The latest stable version of JFSD can be installed directly from PyPI:  

   ```bash
   pip install jfsd
   ```  
   **Note**: This may not include the latest developments in the main branch.  

2. **From Source (Latest Development Version)**:  

   #### 1 - Clone the repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/torrewk/Python-Jax-Fast-Stokesian-Dynamics.git
   cd Python-Jax-Fast-Stokesian-Dynamics
   ```  

   #### 2 - Create and activate a virtual environment  
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```  

   #### 3 - Install the required JAX library  
   ```bash
   pip install jaxlib==0.4.17+cuda11.cudnn86 -f https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/jax_cuda_releases.html
   ```  

   #### 4 - Install JFSD and dependencies  
   ```bash
   pip install ".[test]"
   ```  

   #### 5 - Reboot the environment (needed for pytest to work)  
   ```bash
   deactivate && source .venv/bin/activate
   ```  

   #### 6 - Run unit tests to verify the installation  
   ```bash
   pytest tests/test_class.py
   ```  

For the latest updates and bug fixes, using the **source installation** is recommended.
		
## How to Run Simulations (without GUI)

### 1 - Create a configuration .toml in files/ (use "files/example_configuration.toml" as reference)	
### 2a - Run the main code, from the project directory, via:
```bash
jfsd -c files/<your_config_file.toml> -o <directory_name_for_output>
```
Replace <your_config_file.toml> with the name of the file created in step (1), and <directory_name_for_output> with the name of the folder where you want to store the trajetory data.
### 2b - To provide initial particle positions to jfsd, run it via:
```bash
jfsd -c files/<your_config_file.toml> -s <initial_particle_positions.npy> -o <directory_name_for_output>
```
Replace <initial_particle_positions.npy> with the name of your initial configuration, and modify <your_config_file.toml> to accept initial positions from file (instead of randomly creating it, see 'example_configuration.toml'). Note that this file must be a numpy array of shape (N<sub>p</sub>, 3), with N<sub>p</sub> the number of particles.

## How to Run Simulations (with GUI)
	
### 1 - Launch the GUI, from the project directory, via:
```bash
jfsd-gui
```

## Analyzing Trajectory Data
During the simulation, the particles trajectories,velocities, and stresslets are saved in a numpy array of shape (N<sub>s</sub>, N<sub>p</sub>, N<sub>c</sub>), with N<sub>s</sub> the number of frames stored, N<sub>p</sub> the number of particles and N<sub>c</sub> the number of d.o.f. (3 for trajectories, 6 for velocities, 5 for stresslets). 
**Lengths in the simulation are expressed in units of the particles radius _a_, and momenta in units of _γa_, with unity mass for each particle.**  

## Common/Known Issues

### "Unable to load cuPTI"

This issue can occur if the `PATH` or `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variables are not set correctly to include your CUDA installation, especially the `cuPTI` (CUDA Profiling Tools Interface) library, which JAX requires.

To solve this (temporarily), add the following line to your environment:

```bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/cuda/extras/CUPTI/lib64
```
For a permanent solution, edit the .bashrc file in your home directory:

```bash
echo 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/cuda/extras/CUPTI/lib64' >> ~/.bashrc
```
and apply the changes:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```
Note that, if cuda is installed in a different location than '/usr/local/', you need to modify the lines above accordingly.

## Acknowledgment

The authors acknowledge the Dutch Research Council (NWO) for funding through OCENW.KLEIN.354, as well as the International Fine Particle Research Institute (IFPRI) for funding through collaboration grant CRR-118-01.

We developed JFSD as a way to give back to the fluid dynamics community, whose contributions have shaped our own research. We hope this implementation helps keep the Fast Stokesian Dynamics framework accessible for future studies, continuing the legacy of Fiore and Swan’s excellent algorithms.

We are also grateful to Luca Leone, Athanasios Machas, and Dimos Aslanis for their valuable insights, which improved our understanding of FSD, Google JAX, and the user/developer experience, respectively.
