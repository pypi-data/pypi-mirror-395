# Robot Framework - Appium Extensions (Android)

Custom keywords extending [Robot Framework’s AppiumLibrary](https://github.com/serhatbolsu/robotframework-appiumlibrary), optimized for **mobile automation on Android**.

This library enhances the native AppiumLibrary with new gestures, UI utilities, and validation features designed for **QA teams automating Android applications**.  
It aims to serve as an open-source reference for improving test reliability, coverage, and maintainability in mobile test automation.

## Technology Stack

- **Python 3.9+**
- **Robot Framework 4.0+**
- **Appium Server 2.0+**
- **UiAutomator2 driver (Android)**
- **Appium-Python-Client 5.1.1+**
- **Selenium W3C Actions**
- **OpenCV + scikit-image + NumPy** (for visual comparison)
- **ADB + Android SDK tools**

---

## Prerequisites and Requirements

- Android device or emulator connected with ADB
- Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`
- Appium Server running (`appium` or `appium --allow-cors`)
    ```bash
  npm install -g appium
    ```
- UiAutomator2 driver installed (`appium driver install uiautomator2`)
    ```bash
  appium driver install uiautomator2
    ```

---

## Installation

You can install the package directly from **PyPI** (recommended):
```bash
pip install positivo-appium-extensions
```

Or, if you prefer to work with the latest development version:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<....>.git
cd robotframework-appium-extensions
pip install .
```

---

## How To Run Tests

Run any .robot test suite using Robot Framework’s CLI:
```bash
robot -d results tests/robot/perform_zoom.robot
```
- `-d results` saves logs, reports, and screenshots in a dedicated folder.
- You can adapt paths for your test files or custom resources.

---

## Emulator / Device Setup

To successfully run the automated tests included in this repository, ensure that the test environment (emulator or physical device) meets the following conditions:
- Use an **Android device or emulator** running **Android 11 or higher**.  
- Before executing the test suites, **verify which applications are required** by the selected tests and ensure they are **properly installed** on the device.  
  > For example: some suites may require system apps such as Calculator, Google Maps, or Play Store.
- Using a **Google APIs emulator image** is recommended, as minimal system images may lack these default apps.

---

## Usage Example

```robot
*** Settings ***
Library    AppiumLibrary
Library    robotframework_appium_extensions.keywords.PerformPinch

*** Test Cases ***
Pinch Example
    Open Application    http://localhost:4723    platformName=Android    automationName=UiAutomator2
    Perform Pinch    locator=id=map_view    scale=0.6
```

---

## Known Limitations

- Platform: tested on Android 7.0+; iOS not supported.
- Multi-touch gestures: Android 9+ recommended for reliable Pinch/Zoom (W3C Actions).
- Device fragmentation: differences between manufacturers (Samsung/Xiaomi, etc.) may affect gesture behavior.
- Dynamic elements: fast-moving/animated elements may require explicit waits.
- Power saving mode: can cause inconsistencies; disable during tests.
- Performance: image comparison may be slow on high-resolution screens.

---

## Troubleshooting

- Device not detected: run adb devices → enable USB Debugging; restart ADB (`adb kill-server && adb start-server`).
- Appium session not starting: ensure Appium 2.x is running and uiautomator2 driver installed (`appium driver install uiautomator2`).
- Element not found: validate selectors in Appium Inspector; prefer `id/accessibility_id`; use explicit waits.
- Inconsistent gestures: increase `duration/steps`; add pauses (`pause_before/pause_after`); prefer Android 9+.
- Slow/timeouts: use a good-quality USB cable; disable Android animations; increase timeouts; close background apps.
- ADB errors: ensure `adb` is in your PATH; restart ADB; reconnect the device; check permissions.
