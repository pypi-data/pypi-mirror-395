Compiled Knowledge
==================

Compiled Knowledge is a Python package for compiling and querying discrete probabilistic graphical models.
The aim of the project is:
  - to provide a Python library for compiling and querying
    probabilistic graphical models, specifically discrete factor graphs,
    which includes Bayesian networks
  - to be extremely efficient, flexible, and easy to use
  - to exhibit excellent design, code, and documentation
  - to support researchers and businesses wanting to explore and use 
    probabilistic artificial intelligence.
