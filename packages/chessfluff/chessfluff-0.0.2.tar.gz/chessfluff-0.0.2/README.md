# chessfluff

Application that pulls various stats for a user from [chess.com](https://www.chess.com) using the public API.

Created for my own use, you may be able to use it for reference to understand how to work with the chess.com API.

## Set up

### Update Settings

You will need to update `config.toml` with the settings for your analysis.
