    """
    Class for Functional Connectivity Integrative Normative Modelling (FUNCOIN).

    Attributes:
    -----------
    gamma: False or array-like of shape (q, n_comps). If provided, creates the FUNCOIN class with a predefined Gamma matrix. Default value False.
    beta: False or array-like of shape (n_covariates x n_comps). If provided, creates the FUNCOIN class with a predefined Beta matrix. Default value False.
    dfd_values_training: NaN or vector of size [number of projections] containing "deviation from diagonality" values for the data used to train the model (i.e. identify the projections).
        The attribute is automatically defined when training the model. 
    residual_std_train: NaN or array of length [no. of components]. Element j is the standard deviation of the residuals for the transformed values of projection j. 
    beta_bootstrap: Nan or list of length [number of bootstrap samples] containing beta matrices from the bootstrapping procedure.
        The attribute is defined when running the method .decompose_bootstrap().
    beta_CI_bootstrap: Nan or list of length 2 containing matrices whose elements are the lower and upper bounds of the elementwise confidence intervals of the specified confidence level for the beta matrix.
        These are determined from the bootstrapping procedure.
    beta_CI95_parametric: Nan or list of length 2 containing matrices whose elements are the lower and upper bounds of the elementwise confidence intervals for the beta matrix.
        Only non-Nan if fitted with betaLinReg set to true. The limits are determined from the SE of beta coefficients identified with linear regression.
    u_training: Nan or array-like of shape n_subj x [number of projections]. Contains the transformed data values (u values) of the data the model was trained on.  
    decomp_settings: Python dictionary. Stores variables defined (manually or by default) when calling the method .decompose. This includes: max_comps, gamma_init, rand_init, n_init, max_iter, tol, trace_sol, seed, betaLinReg
        For details, see the docstring of the decompose method.
    gamma_steps_all, beta_steps_all: If Funcoin is fitted with trace_sol set to True, these are lists of length [no. of projections] (otherwise empty). Element j contains a list of length [no. of iterations for projection j] containing the steps in the optimization algorithm. Only the trace from the initial condition giving the best fit is kept.
    _fitted: Boolean variable, which is False when a Funcoin instance is created and set to True if the model is fitted to data (i.e. if gamma and beta are not predefined). Accessed by calling the class method .isfitted(). 
    beta_pvals: Nan or array-like of shape (q,n_dir). If non-Nan, the array contains the coefficient-wise p-values of the hypothesis test for the beta coefficient being equal to 0. Significance level is 0.05.         
        Only non-Nan if fitted with betaLinReg set to true. The p-values are determined from coefficient-wise t-tests of beta coefficients identified with linear regression.
    beta_tvals: Nan or array-like of shape (q,n_dir). If non-Nan, the array contains the coefficient-wise t-values of the hypothesis test for the beta coefficient being equal to 0.
        Only non-Nan if fitted with betaLinReg set to true. The t-values are determined from the SE of beta coefficients identified with linear regression.
    gamma_steps_all, beta_steps_all: If Funcoin is fitted with trace_sol set to True, these attributes are lists of length [no. of projections] (otherwise empty). Element j contains a list of length [no. of iterations for projection j] containing the steps in the optimization algorithm. Only the trace from the initial condition giving the best fit is kept.
    decomp_settings: Dictionary. When running the decomposition method, settings are stored in this dictionary (e.g. number of components, initial conditions, number of iterations, tolerance, etc.) 
    dirs_bad_convergence: List of length [no. of identified projections]. After fitting the model, this list contains the component indices (if any), where the fitting routine of gamma concluded after the maximally allowed number of optimisation iterations rather than meeting the tolerance criteria.
    fitting_steps: List of length [no. of identified projections]. After fitting the model, this list contains the number of iterations used to reach the best fit gamma for each identified component.

        Parameters:
        -----------
        Y_dat: List of length [number of subjects] containing time series data for each subject. Each element of the list should be array-like of shape (T[i], p), with T[i] the number of time points for subject i and p the number of regions/time series. 
        X_dat: Array-like of shape (n_subjects, q). First column has to be ones (does not work without the intercept).

        gamma_init: False or array of length n_regions. If not False, the optimization algorithm uses the array as initial condition for gamma. In the optimisation algorithm, beta is determined from the current gamma, 
                    without utilising an initial beta matrix. Default value False.
        rand_init: Boolean. If True, the decomposition will use random initial gamma values. Default value True.

        low_rank: Boolean. If True, the FC matrices are assumed to be rank-deficient. During the fitting routine, only singular vectors associated with non-zero singular values are considered.

        The order of the FC matrices added must match the order of the subjects' covariates in X_dat. A list of the IDs for already added FC matrices can be obtained with the method self.list_datafiles().

        Parameters:
        -----------
        X_dat: Array-like of shape (n_subjects, q). First column has to be ones (does not work without the intercept).
        Ti_list: Int or list of length [number of subjects] with integer elements. The number of time points in the time series data for all/each subject(s). If the elements are not equal, a weighted average deviation from diagonality values is computed. If all
                    subjects have the same number of time points, this can be specified with an integer instead of a list of integers.
                    As of version 1.3.0, the values of Ti_list will be scaled for better numerical precision and speed of calculations.
                    This scaling is generally recommended but can be turned of by setting the parameter scale_Ti to False.
        ddof: Specifies "delta degrees of freedom" for the input FC matrices. The divisor used for calculating the input FC matrices is T-ddof, with T being the number of time points. Here, default value is 0, which is true for Pearson correlation matrices. 
                    Unbiased covariance (sample covariance) matrix has ddof = 1, which is default when calling numpy.cov(). Population covariance is calculated with ddof=0.  
        max_comps: Maximal number of components (gamma), to be identified. May terminate with fewer components if a singular matrix occurs during the optimisation. This may happen 
                    if the problem is ill-posed, e.g. if no common components can be found or the common directions of variance have already been identified.
        gamma_init: False or array of length n_regions. If not False, the optimization algorithm uses the array as initial condition for gamma. In the optimisation algorithm, beta is determined from the current gamma, 
                    without utilising an initial beta matrix. Default value False.
        rand_init: Boolean. If True, the decomposition will use random initial gamma values. Default value True.
        n_init: Integer. Default value 20. 
        max_iter: Integer>0. Maximal number of iterations when determining gamma (and beta, if betaLinReg is False). Default value 1000.
        tol: Float >0. Maximal tolerance when optimizing for gamma (and beta). If an iteration yields an absolute change smaller than this value in all elements of gamma and beta, the optimisation stops. Default 1e-4.
        trace_sol: Boolean. Whether or not to keep all intermediate steps in the optimization of gamma and beta. The steps are stored in lists in instance variables self.gamma_steps_all and self.beta_steps_all.
        seed_initial: Integer or None. If integer, this seeds the random initial conditions. Default value False.
        betaLinReg: Boolean. If true, the algorithm concludes with performing ordinary linear regression on the transformed values using the gamma transformation found to improve accuracy of beta estimation. Default False.
        overwrite_fit: Boolean. If False: Returns an exception if the class object has already been fitted to data. If True: Fits using the provided data and overwrites any existing values of gamma, beat, dfd_values_training, and u_training.
        low_rank: Boolean. If True, the FC matrices are assumed to be rank-deficient. During the fitting routine, only singular vectors associated with non-zero singular values are considered. 
                            If the matrices are full rank, setting this parameter to True makes no difference on the fitting results, but computation time is increased. Default False.
        silent_mode: Boolean. If False (default), info about which projection is fitted and how many initial conditions have been tried is printed. If set to True, these messages are suppressed.
        scale_Ti: Boolean. If True, the values of Ti_list will be scaled for better numerical precision and speed of calculations.
                    This scaling is generally recommended but can be turned of by setting the parameter scale_Ti to False. Default value is False.

                    without utilising an initial beta matrix. Default value False.
        rand_init: Boolean. If True, the decomposition will use random initial gamma values. Default value True.
        n_init: Integer. Default value 20. 
        max_iter: Integer>0. Maximal number of iterations when determining gamma (and beta, if betaLinReg is False). Default value 1000.
        tol: Float >0. Maximal tolerance when optimizing for gamma (and beta). If an iteration yields an absolute change smaller than this value in all elements of gamma and beta, the optimisation stops. Default 1e-4.
        trace_sol: Boolean. Whether or not to keep all intermediate steps in the optimization of gamma and beta. The steps are stored in lists in instance variables self.gamma_steps_all and self.beta_steps_all.
        seed_initial: Integer or None. If integer, this seeds the random initial conditions. Default value False.
        betaLinReg: Boolean. If true, the algorithm concludes with performing ordinary linear regression on the transformed values using the gamma transformation found to improve accuracy of beta estimation. Default False.
        overwrite_fit: Boolean. If False: Returns an exception if the class object has already been fitted to data. If True: Fits using the provided data and overwrites any existing values of gamma, beat, dfd_values_training, and u_training.
        low_rank: Boolean. If True, the FC matrices are assumed to be rank-deficient. During the fitting routine, only singular vectors associated with non-zero singular values are considered. 
                            If the matrices are full rank, setting this parameter to True makes no difference on the fitting results, but computation time is increased. Default False.
        silent_mode: Boolean. If False (default), info about which projection is fitted and how many initial conditions have been tried is printed. If set to True, these messages are suppressed.
        scale_Ti: Boolean. If True, the values of Ti_list will be scaled for better numerical precision and speed of calculations.
                    This scaling is generally recommended but can be turned of by setting the parameter scale_Ti to False. Default value is False.

        dfd_values_training: Array of length n_dir. Contains the average values of "deviation from diagonality" computed on the data used to fit the model. This can be used for selecting the number of projections (see Zhao, Y. et al. (2021)). 
        u_training: The transformed values of the data used to fit the model, i.e. the logarithm of the diagonal elements of Gamma.T @ Sigma_i @Gamma for subject i.
        residual_std_train: Projection-wise standard deviation of the residuals (i.e. transformed values minus the mean). Computed assuming homogeneity of variance.
        beta_CI95_parametric: Nan or list of length 2 containing matrices whose elements are the lower and upper bounds of the elementwise confidence intervals for the beta matrix.
                        Only non-Nan if fitted with betaLinReg set to true. The limits are determined from the SE of beta coefficients identified with linear regression.
        beta_pvals: Nan or array-like of shape (q,n_dir). If non-Nan, the array contains the coefficient-wise p-values of the hypothesis test for the beta coefficient being equal to 0. Significance level is 0.05.

Element j contains a list of length [no. of iterations for projection j] containing the steps in the optimization algorithm. Only the trace from the initial condition giving the best fit is kept.        
        decomp_settings: Dictionary. When running the decomposition method, settings are stored in this dictionary (e.g. number of components, initial conditions, number of iterations, tolerance, etc.) 
        dirs_bad_convergence: List of length [no. of identified projections]. Contains the component indices (if any), where the fitting routine of gamma concluded after the maximally allowed number of optimisation iterations rather than meeting the tolerance criteria.
        fitting_steps: List of length [no. of identified projections]. Contains the number of iterations used to reach the best fit gamma for each identified component.

        -----------
        gamma_dir: The direction up to which the dfd value is calculated. 
        Y_dat: List of length [number of subjects] containing time series data for each subject. Each element of the list should be array-like of shape (T[i], p), with T[i] the number of time points for subject i and p the number of regions/time series.
        weighted_io: Boolean or 0/1. If set to True/1, the average dfd value is a weighted average according to the number of time points for each subject. If all subjects have the same number of time points, setting this parameter to 1 can improve estimation by reducing the risk of overflow.
        dfd_aritm: Boolean or 0/1. If set to False/0, the average dfd value is computed as the geometric mean (weighted or unweighted according to the weighted_io parameter). If 1, the arithmetic mean is used. Default value is 0. 
        logtrick_io: Boolean of 0/1. When computing the harmonic mean, a log-transformation is temporarily applied to avoid overflow. Recommended, but can be disabled to test the difference. Default value 1.
