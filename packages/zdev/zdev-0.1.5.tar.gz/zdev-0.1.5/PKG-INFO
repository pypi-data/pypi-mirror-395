# zdev

## Synopsis

Versatile collection of routines & tools for common development tasks.

## Contents

This library provides handy routines & tools for common tasks during development as well as for productive use in Python programs (e.g. stripping ```fileparts()```). Application focus is on *scripts for automation* as well as on *algorithmic functions*.

The package is structured into the following modules:  

- **base**: init for Python console session & tools for automatic project deployment

- **core**: main collection of development functions (e.g. for type-checks, info strings, mass file operations or dependency tracking)

- **indexing**: helpers related to "find-type" of tasks (e.g. runlength sections or file-goto)

- **parallel**: convenience functions that build on Python's native ```multiprocessing``` package and classes for controllable dispatching of jobs onto N cores

- **plot**: routines for a single-line yet sophisticated control of figures based on ```matplotlib``` or ```plotly``` packages.
*Note: In order to support ```zynamon.zeit.TimeSeries``` the underlying package must be known and accessible as well!*

- **testing**: set of small dummy functions w/ and w/o arguments that can be used for testing (e.g. for routines in ```zdev.parallel```)

- **validio**: functions for a robust I/O behaviour (i.e. automatic replacement of "problematic" characters etc)

- **colors**: central definition of common color codes (RGB) in human-readable form (e.g. ```cPurple```)

- **searchstr**: central definition of common strings used in regular expressions

More specialized tools can be found in:

- **ccnx**: "C-core nexus", providing simplified access to C-code DLLs (using ```ctypes``` package)
- **libDSP**: support for access to "libDSP.dll" - a hand-crafted C-code library for signal processing
- **xlcmp**: functions to compare rows or sheets of Excel workbooks and highlighting results in exported copies (using ```openpyxl``` package)
- **sigproc**: some basic signal processing tests (ALPHA!)
