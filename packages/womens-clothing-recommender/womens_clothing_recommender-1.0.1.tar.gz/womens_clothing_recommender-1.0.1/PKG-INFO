# ✨ Recommendation Prediction from Women’s Clothing Reviews

This project is a machine learning system that predicts whether a product will be **recommended or not (0/1)** using **23,486 customer reviews** collected from a real e-commerce platform.

By combining natural language processing (NLP), feature engineering, categorical data processing, and ensemble models, the system achieves a high-level performance of **0.974 ROC AUC**.

## 🧠 Why This Model?

A multi-layer approach was adopted using the advanced pipeline below:

| Component                               | Reason                                                                          |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Soft Voting Ensemble**                | Combines the strengths of Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM           |
| **TF-IDF + Truncated SVD**              | Reduces text dimensionality from 5000 → 100 for speed + performance             |
| **Custom `ReviewFeatures` Transformer** | Adds emotional/structural signals like review length and number of exclamations |
| **Pipeline + GridSearchCV**             | Fully automated preprocessing + best hyperparameters                            |

### 🔍 Why Is `ReviewFeatures` So Effective?

These additional signals boosted the F1 score by **2%**:

* Longer review → more thoughtful → more likely recommended
* Many “!” → higher emotional tone → usually positive
* Short title → often negative (“Too small”, “Didn’t like it”)

Therefore, the structural properties of the review are as valuable as the text itself.
