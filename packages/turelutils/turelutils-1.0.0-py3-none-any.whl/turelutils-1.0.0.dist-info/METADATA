# TurelUtils

Small, practical Python utility helpers used across personal projects.

## Overview

`turelutils` is a lightweight collection of utility modules packaged under the `src/turelutils` namespace. It contains small, focused helpers for common tasks such as string manipulation, hashing, time helpers, and small type utilities. The package is intended for local use and easy reuse across projects.

## Features

- Collection of focused utility modules:
  - `constants` — project constants and shared values
  - `hash_utils` — hashing helpers and convenience functions
  - `menu_utlis` — small menu/UI helpers (note: spelled `menu_utlis` in the package)
  - `string_utils` — common string helpers (formatting, parsing, normalization)
  - `time_utils` — helpers for time parsing/formatting
  - `type_utils` — lightweight type helpers and checks
- Small, dependency-light, and easy to import into other projects

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+ recommended

## Installation (local development)

To install the package into your local environment in editable mode:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

This installs the package from the repository root using the `src/` layout.

If you have a virtual environment, activate it first:

Windows (cmd.exe):

```cmd
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Usage

Import modules from the package directly. Example usage pattern:

```python
# import a module
from turelutils import string_utils, hash_utils

# call functions from the module (replace `some_function` with the actual helper name)
# result = string_utils.some_function("value")
# digest = hash_utils.hash_value("secret")

print("Modules loaded:", string_utils, hash_utils)
```

Because the package follows a `src` layout, you can also run tools from the project root while the package is installed in editable mode.

## Contributing

- Please open issues or pull requests with enhancements or bug fixes.
- Follow standard best practices: small, focused PRs with a clear description.

## Tests & CI

There are no tests included in this repository by default. If you add tests, consider using `pytest` and configuring a GitHub Actions workflow for CI.

## License

No license file is included in the repository. Add a `LICENSE` file (for example, `MIT` or `Apache-2.0`) to make usage terms explicit.

## Notes

- The module `menu_utlis.py` appears to have a typo in its filename (`utlis` vs `utils`). If that's unintentional and you prefer `menu_utils`, consider renaming the file and updating imports.
- This README provides usage patterns and installation steps — update examples with real function names from the modules for clearer guidance.

If you'd like, I can:

- Inspect the individual modules and add concrete usage examples for the most useful functions.
- Add a simple `LICENSE` file (MIT by default) and a minimal contribution guideline.
