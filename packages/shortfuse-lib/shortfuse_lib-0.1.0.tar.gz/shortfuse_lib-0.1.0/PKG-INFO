**Don't just raise exceptions—kill the process.**

`shortfuse` is a zero-tolerance "fail fast" utility for enforcing architectural boundaries. It creates uncatchable traps in deprecated code paths to instantly halt execution and expose regressions.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation
```bash
pip install shortfuse-lib
```

### The "Loud" Failure
When shortfuse halts, it bypasses try/except blocks and finally handlers by using `os._exit(1)`.

```python
import shortfuse

# 1. Dead Code Trap
shortfuse.halt("Legacy endpoint is dead")

# 2. Conditional Trap
shortfuse.halt_unless(config.v3_enabled, "Must use V3 Config")

# 3. Dependency Trap
shortfuse.halt_if_not_none(legacy_client, "Legacy client must be removed")
```

For the full visual demonstration of the stack trace, see the [Documentation](https://lbrichards.github.io/shortfuse/shortfuse.html).
