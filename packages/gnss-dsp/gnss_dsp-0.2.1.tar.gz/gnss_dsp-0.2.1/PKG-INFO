# gnss-dsp

`gnss-dsp` is a set of signal processing tools for GNSS. It is mainly
implemented in Rust, with some Python for scripting and plotting. It can be used
as a Python package, which contains some CLI tools, and as a Rust crate, for
access to most of the functionality within Rust projects.

Currently this package contains a CUDA high-sensitivity acquisition algorithm
for GPS L1 C/A.

## Development

This repository uses [just](github.com/casey/just) to run common development
tasks. Run `just` to print the available recipes. The recommended way of doing
development is to create a Python virtual environment, activate it, and run
`just develop`, which calls `maturin develop` to build the package and install
it into the virtual environment.

[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) is required to run several development tasks.
