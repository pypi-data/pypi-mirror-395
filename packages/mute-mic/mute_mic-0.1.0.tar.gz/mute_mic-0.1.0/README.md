# mute-mic

Windows does not have a command to globally (un)mute your microphone which can be mapped
from a key. `mute-mic` solves that problem.

## Install

[UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) makes it easy to install command line programs made in Python.

With UV, you can install `mute-mic`:

`uv tool install mute-mic`

## Usage

From the command line, you can call `mute-mic` to mute or unmute your microphone.
You can map a key to this program with ie Powertoys (get the path to the command via `where mute-mic` and
choose Hidden as visibility)
