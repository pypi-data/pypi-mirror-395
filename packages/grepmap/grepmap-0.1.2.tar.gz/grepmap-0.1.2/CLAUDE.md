=== Work Standard ===

* Use `ty check` and `uvx ruff check` after big changes to verify
* Keep your eyes peeled and proactively whisper to the user when you notice a refactor that can simplify the code or architectural or abstraction extraction, suggesting possible encapsulations that would be elegant. Sometimes we hack on a project and we don't expect it to grow and all these features to come in, and we end up with a 1500 line monolith!
