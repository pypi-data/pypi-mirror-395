@dataclass(frozen=True, kw_only=True)
class TextLinesStream(IO[Generator[str]]):
    """IO representing a file stream
    as a generator of lines.

    Useful for processing large files line-by-line.

    By default, lines are separated by newline characters
    during load.

    When saving, the newline character is appended to each line
    by default, this can be changed by providing a different `end` argument
    to the `save` method using `with_save_options`.

    Examples:

    ```pycon
    >>> from ordeq_files import TextLinesStream
    >>> from pathlib import Path
    >>> my_file = TextLinesStream(
    ...     path=Path("path/to.txt")
    ... )

    >>> my_file_no_endline = TextLinesStream(
    ...     path=Path("path/to.txt")
    ... ).with_save_options(end="")

    ```
