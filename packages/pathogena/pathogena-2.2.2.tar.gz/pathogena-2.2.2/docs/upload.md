> Where samples may contain human reads we strongly recommend using the provided decontamination functionality. This is
best practice to minimise the risk of personally identifiable information being uploaded to the cloud.

The upload command performs metadata validation and client-side removal of human reads for each of your samples,
before uploading sequences to EIT Pathogena for analysis.

To generate a CSV file to use with this command see the [build-csv](#pathogena-build-csv) documentation.

### Credits

Credits are required to upload samples and initiate the analysis process. Users can check their credit balance in the
header of the Pathogena Portal or by using the `pathogena balance` command. More information can be found in the
`pathogena balance` section.

Each sample for Mycobacterium genomic sequencing will require 10 credits whereas SARS-CoV-2 sample sequencing will require 1 credits.
During the upload command process, a balance check is performed to ensure the user has enough credits for the number of samples in the batch.
Credits are then deducted when sample files are successfully uploaded and ready for processing.

### Human Read Removal

A 4GB human genome index is downloaded the first time you run `pathogena upload`. If for any reason this is interrupted,
run the upload command again. Upload will not proceed until the index has been downloaded and passed an integrity
check. You may optionally download the index ahead of time using the command `pathogena download-index`.

By default, the upload command will first run `pathogena decontaminate` to attempt to remove human reads prior to
uploading the input samples to EIT Pathogena, this option can be overridden but only do so if you're aware of the risks
stated above.

To retain the decontaminated FASTQ files uploaded to EIT Pathogena, include the optional `--save` flag. To perform
decontamination without uploading anything, use the `pathogena decontaminate` command.

During upload, a mapping CSV is created (e.g. `a5w2e8.mapping.csv`) linking your local sample names with their randomly
generated remote names. Keep this file safe, as it is useful for downloading and relinking results later, it cannot be
recreated after this step without re-uploading the same samples again.
