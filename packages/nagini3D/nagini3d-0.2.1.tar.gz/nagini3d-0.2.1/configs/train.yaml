data:
  patch_size: 80,80,80   # int,int,int: size of the patch cropped in the images to feed the network, reduce in case of "Cuda Out Of Memory" 
  data_aug: true   # bool: random flips along x,y,z axis for data augmentation

settings:
  experiment_name: NAGINI-3D  # str: experiment name used to store the network during training and log informations on WandB
  nb_points_on_surface: 101  # int: number of points sampled on the surface to compute the sliced wasserstein distance loss, reduce in case of "Cuda Out Of Memory" 
  nb_epochs: 2000  # int: nb of epochs during training
  use_wandb: true  # bool: weither to log or not losses on WandB to follow the training in live 
  batch_size: 1  # int: batch_size used for training 
  M1: 8     # int: parameter defining the smoothness of the surface, keep it small if you use the snake refinement
  M2: 4     # int: parameter defining the smoothness of the surface (try to keep M1=2M2), keep it small if you use the snake refinement
  seed: 0   # int: fix a seed if you need reproducibility in your training

loss:
  reg_ratio: 0.01       # float in [0,1]: weight the regularisation preventing surface twists, keep it zero for small values of M1 and M2 (typically 4,2), increase if you augment them. 
  lambdas:    
    snakes: 1.0       # float: weight the surface loss
    spots: 1.0        # float: weight the probability loss used for center detection

save:
  path: <path_to_model_save_dir>  # str: path to the dir where the model trained will be stored
