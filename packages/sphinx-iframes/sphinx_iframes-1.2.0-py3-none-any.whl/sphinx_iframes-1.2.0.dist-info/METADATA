# Iframes

This extension provides an interface to include iframes with relative ease, but does try to provide manners to interact with the various options. This rests purely by setting default CSS values, that the user can overwrite if preferred for individual iframes, but also globally. In general, each `iframe` is embedded within a `div` element, which eases sizing.

> [!NOTE]
> Using CSS is complicated and error prone, so always check and never expect that you get what you want.

## What does it do?

This extension provides several Sphinx directives:

- `iframe`
- `h5p`
- `video`
- `iframe-figure`
- `video-figure`
- `h5p-figure`

 that can be used to quickly insert an iframe with standard sizing and styling.

## Installation
To use this extension, follow these steps:

**Step 1: Install the Package**

Install the module `sphinx-iframes` package using `pip`:
```
pip install sphinx-iframes
```
    
**Step 2: Add to `requirements.txt`**

Make sure that the package is included in your project's `requirements.txt` to track the dependency:
```
sphinx-iframes
```

**Step 3: Enable in `_config.yml`**

In your `_config.yml` file, add the extension to the list of Sphinx extra extensions (**important**: underscore, not dash this time):
```
sphinx: 
    extra_extensions:
        .
        .
        .
        - sphinx_iframes
        .
        .
        .
```

## Configuration

The extension provides several configuration values, which can be added to `_config.yml`:

```yaml
sphinx: 
    config:
        -
        -
        -
        iframe_blend:          true # default value
        iframe_saturation:     1.5 # default value
        iframe_h5p_autoresize: true # default value
        iframe_background:     "#ffffff" # default value
        iframe_width:          calc(100% - 2.8rem) # default value
        iframe_aspectratio:    auto 2 / 1 # default value
        iframe_loading:        lazy # default value
        -
        -
        -
```

- `iframe_blend`: `true` (_default_) or `false`:
  - if `true` all iframes are standard blended with the background and in dark-mode also inverted.
  - if `false` all non-blended iframes will have background a colored background and no inversion for dark-mode is applied.
  - there's no need to set the blend or no-blend for individual iframes if it's set in the `_config.yml`, unless you want to deviate from the setting set there.
- `iframe_saturation`: `1.5` (_default_) or **float**:
  - Blended iframes are inverted in dark mode using the CSS filter `invert(1) hue-rotate(180deg) saturation(iframe_saturation)`.
- `iframe_h5p_autoresize`: `true` (_default_) or `false`:
  - if `true` all h5p iframes are automagically resized to fit the element in which the iframe is loaded.
  - if `false` no h5p iframes are automagically resized to fit the element in which the iframe is loaded.
- `iframe_background`: `"#ffffff"` (_default_) or **CSS string**:
  - sets the standard background color of non-blended iframes.
  - Any CSS string defining colors can be used, see [<color> CSS data type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value).
  - Surround with `" "` for hex strings.
  - Only visible if the content of the iframes has a transparent background. 
- `iframe_width`:  `calc(100% - 2.8rem)` (_default_) or **CSS string**:
  - sets the standard width of the iframe within the parent element;
  - Any CSS string defining a width can be used, see [width CSS property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/width).
- `iframe_aspectratio`: `auto 2 / 1` (_default_) or **CSS string**:
  - sets the standard aspect ration of the iframe within the parent element;
  - Any CSS string defining an aspect ratio can be used, see [aspect-ratio CSS property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/aspect-ratio).
- `iframe_loading`: `lazy` (_default_) or `eager`:
  - sets the standard loading attribute of the iframe;
  - see [loading attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/iframe#loading).

## Provided code

### Directives

The following new directives are provided:

````md
```{iframe} <link_to_webpage_to_embed>
```
````

````md
```{h5p} <link_to_h5p_webpage_to_embed>
```
````

````md
```{video} <link_to_video_to_embed>
```
````

In case of a YouTube-link, it is inverted to an embed link if the normal web URL is provided. H5p links are converted too if provided without `/embed`.

For the `video` directive, if a direct link to a video file is provided (e.g. ending on `.mp4`, `.webm` or `.ogg`), then the `video` directive from [sphinxcontrib.video](https://sphinxcontrib-video.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html) is used. If any other link is provided, then an iframe is generated.

````md
```{iframe-figure} <link_to_webpage_to_embed>
:name: some:label

The caption for the iframe.
```
````

````md
```{h5p-figure} <link_to_h5p_webpage_to_embed>
:name: some:label

The caption for the h5p webpage.
```
````

````md
```{video-figure} <link_to_video_to_embed>
:name: some:label

The caption for the video.
```
````

Note that you don't need the full embed code of an iframe. Only the source url should be used.

All of these have the following options:

- `:class:`
  - If further CSS styling is needed, then use this option to append a CSS class name to the rendered iframe.
  - We recommend to only use the classes `blend` and `no-blend`, see [](sec:iframes:examples).
- `:divclass:`
  - If further CSS styling is needed, then use this option to append a CSS class name to the div surrounding the iframe.
- `:width:`
  - Sets the width of the iframe. Use CSS compatible strings.
- `:height:`
  - Sets the width of the iframe. Use CSS compatible strings.
- `:aspectratio:`
  - Sets the width of the iframe. Use CSS compatible strings.
- `:styleframe:`
  - Sets the style of the iframe. Use CSS compatible strings. Surround with " ".
- `:stylediv:`
  - Sets the style of the surrounding div. Use CSS compatible strings. Surround with " ".
- `:loading:`
  - Sets the loading attribute of the iframe. Use either `lazy` or `eager`.
  - If unset, the global configuration value is used.

For the directive `video`, if a direct link to a video file is given, then only the options from the `video` directive from [sphinxcontrib.video](https://sphinxcontrib-video.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html) should be used. For any other link, the options above should be used.

The directives `iframe-figure`, `video-figure` and `h5p-figure` also inherit all options from the `figure` directive from the extension `sphinx_metadata_figure`.

## Metadata

The `iframe-figure`, `video-figure` and `h5p-figure` directives use the `figure` directive from the `sphinx_metadata_figure` extension to add metadata to the figures they create. This metadata can include information such as author, license, copyright, and source. This information is useful for documentation and attribution purposes.

> [!NOTE]
> This extension always loads the extension `sphinx_metadata_figure` as it depends on it to add metadata to the figures. This means that also the configuration options of that extension are available and if this is not desired, you must disable the workings of that extensions by applying appropriate settings in `metadata_figure_settings` in your Sphinx configuration file. See the [documentation](https://teachbooks.io/manual/_git/github.com_TeachBooks_Sphinx-Metadata-Figure/main/MANUAL.html) of the `sphinx_metadata_figure` extension for more information.
