## [0.2.7] - 2025-12-04

- Fixed
  - Bug where non-ASCII characters would mess up auto formatting
- Full diff
  - https://github.com/jsh9/format-docstring/compare/0.2.6...0.2.7

## [0.2.6] - 2025-11-21

- Fixed
  - Multiline annotations now normalize without inserting spaces inside
    `Literal[...]` or other bracketed signatures, even when they span several
    lines.
  - A bug where bare `*args`/`**kwargs` signature lines (typed or untyped)
    would be merged into previous descriptions
  - NumPy signature syncing left the `:class:` / `:meth:` role prefixes behind,
    producing mismatched annotations like ` : MyClass`
- Full diff
  - https://github.com/jsh9/format-docstring/compare/0.2.5...0.2.6

## [0.2.5] - 2025-11-20

- Fixed
  - A bug where `Generator[XXX, YYY, ZZZ]` in the return type annotation is not
    parsed correctly (the Yields section should have been XXX)

- Fixed
  - A bug where 2nd pair of backticks can't be added for dunder names (such as
    `__init__`)
  - A bug where input args named `default` would get treated incorrectly (the
    tool would confuse it with the default values)
- Full diff
  - https://github.com/jsh9/format-docstring/compare/0.2.3...0.2.4

## [0.2.3] - 2025-10-22

## [0.2.2] - 2025-10-20

- Added
  - Formatting support for type hints and default values in class docstrings

- Full diff
  - https://github.com/jsh9/format-docstring/compare/0.2.0...0.2.1

## [0.2.0] - 2025-10-20

- Added
  - AST-driven synchronization of NumPy `Parameters` and `Returns` signature
    lines with the function signature, including tuple element expansion for
    multi-line return blocks
- Full diff
  - https://github.com/jsh9/format-docstring/compare/0.1.9...0.2.0

## [0.1.9] - 2025-10-16

- Added
  - A "`# no-format-docstring`" directive to ignore certain docstring
  - Verbose diff output via `--verbose diff` and
    `[tool.format_docstring] verbose`
  - Normalize NumPy section headings that include trailing colons (e.g.,
    `Parameters:`); also, fix Google-style "Arg" header into "Parameters"
- Changed
  - Added "self format" pre-commit hook to format docstrings within this repo
    with its own formatting logic
- Full diff
  - https://github.com/jsh9/format-docstring/compare/0.1.8...0.1.9

## [0.1.8] - 2025-10-14

- Fixed
  - Bug in `_fix_rst_backticks()` where backtick pairs spanning multiple lines
    (e.g., multi-line external links) were incorrectly processed
  - Added `(?!_)` lookahead to regex pattern to prevent matching trailing
    backticks from cross-references (e.g., `` `text`_ ``)
- Changed
  - Moved backtick fixing from line-by-line processing to whole-docstring
    processing to correctly handle multi-line constructs
  - REPL lines (starting with `>>> ` or `... `) are now protected with
    placeholders during backtick fixing to preserve backticks in Python
    examples
- Added
  - Test cases for multi-line external links in
    `test_fix_rst_backticks_cases()`
  - Test cases for REPL lines with backticks in
    `test_fix_rst_backticks_cases()`

  - https://github.com/jsh9/format-docstring/compare/0.1.7...0.1.8

## [0.1.7] - 2025-10-14

- Fixed
  - Backtick fixing logic to properly distinguish between inline literals and
    external links (e.g., `` `Python <https://example.org>`_ ``)
  - Refactored `_fix_rst_backticks()` to use pre-compiled regex pattern for
    better performance
- Full diff

## [0.1.6] - 2025-10-13
