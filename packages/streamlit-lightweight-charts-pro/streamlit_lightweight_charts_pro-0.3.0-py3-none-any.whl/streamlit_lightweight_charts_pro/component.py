"""Component initialization for Streamlit Lightweight Charts Pro.

This module handles the initialization of the Streamlit custom component that
enables TradingView Lightweight Charts in Streamlit applications. It manages
the component lifecycle, handles both development and production modes, and
provides utilities for debugging component initialization issues.

The module uses Streamlit's components API to create a bidirectional bridge
between Python (backend) and React/JavaScript (frontend). This bridge allows:
    - Sending chart configuration from Python to JavaScript
    - Receiving user interactions from JavaScript back to Python
    - Managing component state and lifecycle
    - Hot reloading during development

Key Features:
    - Automatic mode detection (development vs production)
    - Lazy component initialization to avoid import cycles
    - Comprehensive error handling and logging
    - Debug utilities for troubleshooting
    - Support for component reinitialization

Architecture:
    The component follows a singleton pattern where _component_func is
    initialized once at module import time. This ensures consistent behavior
    across the application and avoids redundant initialization overhead.

    Component Modes:
        - Production (_RELEASE=True): Uses pre-built static files from
          frontend/build directory. Optimized for deployment.
        - Development (_RELEASE=False): Connects to local dev server at
          localhost:3001 for hot reloading and rapid iteration.

Example:
    Basic chart rendering::

        from streamlit_lightweight_charts_pro.component import get_component_func

        # Get the initialized component function
        component_func = get_component_func()

        if component_func:
            # Render a chart with configuration
            result = component_func(config={"chart_options": {...}}, key="my_chart")
        else:
            st.error("Chart component failed to initialize")

    Debugging initialization issues::

        from streamlit_lightweight_charts_pro.component import (
            debug_component_status,
            reinitialize_component,
        )

        # Check component status
        status = debug_component_status()
        print(f"Component initialized: {status['component_initialized']}")

        # Attempt reinitialization if needed
        if not status["component_initialized"]:
            success = reinitialize_component()
            print(f"Reinitialization {'succeeded' if success else 'failed'}")

Note:
    The module initializes the component automatically at import time.
    Component initialization failures are logged but don't raise exceptions,
    allowing the application to start even if charts can't be rendered.

Raises:
    ImportError: If Streamlit components module cannot be imported
    FileNotFoundError: If frontend build directory is missing in production

def get_component_func() -> Optional[Callable[..., Any]]:
    """Get the Streamlit component function for rendering charts.

    This function returns the initialized component function that enables
    chart rendering in Streamlit applications. The component function acts
    as a bridge between Python configuration and the React frontend.

    The returned function can be called with chart configuration to render
    interactive TradingView Lightweight Charts. It handles serialization,
    communication with the JavaScript frontend, and state management.

    Returns:
        Optional[Callable[..., Any]]: The component function if successfully
            initialized, None if initialization failed. When not None, the
            function has the signature:

            Where:
                - config: Chart configuration dictionary
                - key: Unique identifier for the component instance
                - height: Component height in pixels

def reinitialize_component() -> bool:
    """Attempt to reinitialize the component if it failed to load initially.

    This function provides a recovery mechanism for component initialization
    failures. It's useful when the frontend build was missing at import time
    but has since been built, or when temporary errors prevented loading.

    The function attempts to reinitialize the component using the same logic
    as the initial _initialize_component() call. It respects the current
    mode (production vs development) and updates the global _component_func.

    Returns:
        bool: True if reinitialization succeeded, False if it failed.
            Success means the component function was successfully declared
            and is ready for use. Failure indicates persistent issues that
            require investigation.

    Example:
        Retry after building frontend::

            >>> # Initial load failed, build frontend
            >>> subprocess.run(["npm", "run", "build"], cwd="frontend")

    """Initialize the component function based on environment.

    This is an internal function called automatically at module import time
    to set up the Streamlit component. It detects the current mode
    (production vs development) and initializes the component accordingly.

    The function is idempotent - calling it multiple times is safe, though
    typically it's only called once during module initialization.

    The initialization process:
        1. Checks the _RELEASE flag to determine mode
        2. In production: Verifies frontend build exists and declares component
        3. In development: Declares component pointing to dev server
        4. Logs all steps for debugging
        5. Sets _component_func on success, None on failure

    Component Initialization Details:
        Production Mode (_RELEASE=True):
            - Looks for frontend/build directory
            - Verifies directory exists before declaring component
            - Uses components.declare_component() with path parameter
            - Logs errors if build directory is missing

        Development Mode (_RELEASE=False):
            - Declares component with url parameter
            - Points to http://localhost:3001 for dev server
            - Assumes developer has started dev server manually
            - Useful for hot reloading during development

    Side Effects:
        - Modifies global _component_func variable
        - Writes log messages at INFO, WARNING, and ERROR levels
        - May attempt filesystem operations in production mode

    Note:
        This function is called automatically when the module is imported.
        Manual calls to this function are unnecessary and may cause
        duplicate logging. Use reinitialize_component() instead for
        manual reinitialization.

        Error Handling:
            All exceptions are caught and logged. The function never raises
            exceptions to prevent import failures. If initialization fails,
            _component_func is set to None and the error is logged.
