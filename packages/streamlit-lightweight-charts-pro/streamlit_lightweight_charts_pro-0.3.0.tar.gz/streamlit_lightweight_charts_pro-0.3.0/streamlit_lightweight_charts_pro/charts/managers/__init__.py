"""Manager classes for Chart component.

This module provides specialized manager classes that handle different
aspects of chart functionality, promoting separation of concerns and
maintainability.

Core managers (framework-agnostic) are imported from lightweight_charts_pro.
Streamlit-specific managers are defined in this package.
