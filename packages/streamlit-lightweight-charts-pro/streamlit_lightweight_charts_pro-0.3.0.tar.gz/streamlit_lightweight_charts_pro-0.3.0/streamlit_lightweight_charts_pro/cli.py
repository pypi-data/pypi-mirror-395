"""Command-line interface for streamlit-lightweight-charts-pro.

This module provides command-line utilities for managing the
streamlit-lightweight-charts-pro package, including frontend building,
dependency management, and development tools.

The CLI supports:
    - Frontend build management and validation
    - Dependency installation and updates
    - Development environment setup
    - Package validation and testing

Key Features:
    - Automatic frontend build detection and building
    - NPM dependency management with validation
    - Development vs production mode handling
    - Error handling with clear user messages
    - Cross-platform compatibility

Example:
    Build frontend assets::

        $ python -m streamlit_lightweight_charts_pro build-frontend

    Check frontend build status::

        $ python -m streamlit_lightweight_charts_pro check

    Show version information::

        $ python -m streamlit_lightweight_charts_pro version

Note:
    This module requires Node.js and NPM to be installed for
    frontend build operations.

def check_frontend_build():
    """Check if frontend is built and trigger build if necessary.

    This function validates that the frontend build directory exists and
    contains the required static assets. If the frontend is not built or
    missing static assets, it automatically triggers the build process.

    The function checks for:
        - Existence of the 'build' directory
        - Existence of the 'static' subdirectory within build

    Returns:
        bool: True if frontend is built successfully or already exists,
            False if build fails.

    Example:

def build_frontend():
    """Build the frontend assets using NPM.

    This function handles the complete frontend build process including
    dependency installation, production build execution, and error handling.

    The build process:
        1. Locates NPM executable in system PATH
        2. Changes to frontend directory
        3. Installs NPM dependencies via 'npm install'
        4. Runs production build via 'npm run build'
        5. Restores original working directory

    Returns:
        bool: True if build succeeds, False otherwise.

    Raises:
        NpmNotFoundError: If NPM is not installed or not found in PATH.
        ValueError: If NPM path validation fails.

    Note:
        The function uses shell=False for security to prevent command
        injection attacks. It also validates the NPM path before execution.
