# simpple: Simple Probablistic Programming Language (PPL)

`simpple` is a framework to easily build models that can be used with common Python samplers (emcee, pymultinest, ultranest, etc.).
It provides common distributions, a `Model` class and utility functions to easily build and re-use models.
The goal of `simpple` is to bring some of the features from probabilistic programming languages such as PyMC and Numpyro for models that were not implemented with a tensor library such as PyTensor or JAX.

Take a look at the documentation for more information: <https://simpple.readthedocs.io>
