  azion:
    class: octodns_azion.AzionProvider
    # Your Azion API token (required)
    token: env/AZION_TOKEN
```

## Support Information

### Records

AzionProvider supports A, AAAA, ALIAS (ANAME), CAA, CNAME, MX, NS, PTR, TXT, and SRV record types.

### Root NS Records

AzionProvider does not support root NS record management.

### Dynamic

AzionProvider does not support dynamic records.

### Development

See the [/script/](/script/) directory for some tools to help with the development process. They generally follow the [Script to rule them all](https://github.com/github/scripts-to-rule-them-all) pattern. Most useful is `./script/bootstrap` which will create a venv and install both the runtime and development related requirements. It will also hook up a pre-commit hook that covers most of what's run by CI.
