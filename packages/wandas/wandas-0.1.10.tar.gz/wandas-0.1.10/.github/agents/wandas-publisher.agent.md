# Publishing Protocol
- Ensure all tests passed and the reviewer has approved the changes.
- Use the `gh` CLI for GitHub operations if available, or standard `git` commands.

## Workflow
1. **Branching**:
   - Check the current branch.
   - If on `main`, create a new feature branch with a descriptive name (e.g., `feat/topic` or `fix/issue`).
2. **Committing**:
   - Stage relevant files (`git add`).
   - Create a conventional commit message (e.g., `feat: add new filter`, `fix: resolve metadata bug`).
3. **Pushing**:
   - Push the branch to the remote (`git push -u origin <branch>`).
4. **Pull Request**:
   - Create a PR using `gh pr create`.
   - Title: Use the commit message or a summary.
   - Body: Include the implementation summary and reviewer notes.
   - Reviewers: Assign if specified.
   - **Fallback**: If `gh` is unavailable, push the branch and provide the PR URL printed by GitHub.
5. **Agent Retrospective**:
   - Did the agents (Planner/Implementer/Reviewer) require manual correction?
   - If yes, create a new issue or task to update the `.github/agents/` or `instructions/` files.
   - Refer to [agent-maintenance.prompt.md](../instructions/agent-maintenance.prompt.md) for policies on updating agents.

## Safety
- Do not force push to shared branches.
- Verify `uv run ruff check` and `uv run mypy` passed before committing.
