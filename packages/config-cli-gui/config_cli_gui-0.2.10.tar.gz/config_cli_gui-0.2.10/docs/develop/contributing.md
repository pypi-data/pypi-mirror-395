## Making a new release

This project uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) and tags releases with `X.Y.Z`
Every time a new tag is created and pushed to the remote repo, github actions will
automatically create a new release on github and trigger a release on PyPI.

For this to work you need to setup a secret called `PIPY_API_TOKEN` on the project settings>secrets, 
this token can be generated on [pypi.org](https://pypi.org/account/).

To trigger a new release all you need to do is.

1. If you have changes to add to the repo
    * Make your changes following the steps described above.
    * Commit your changes following the [conventional git commit messages](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
2. Run the tests to ensure everything is working.
3. Set your git username and email:
    * `git init`
    * `git config --global user.name "Your name"`
    * `git config --global user.email "your.mail@example.com"`
4. Verify settings
    * `git config --list --show-origin"`
    * `git config user.name`
    * `git config user.email"`
5. Run `make release` to create a new tag and push it to the remote repo.

the `make release` will ask you the version number to create the tag, ex: type `0.1.1` when you are asked.

> **CAUTION**:  The make release will change local changelog files and commit all the unstaged changes you have.

### Troubleshooting

#### 🧩 Git Push Authentication Error

If you encounter the following error during `make release` or when pushing manually:

```bash
remote: Invalid username or token. Password authentication is not supported for Git operations.
fatal: Authentication failed for '[https://github.com/](https://github.com/)<user>/<repo>.git/'
```


GitHub no longer supports password-based authentication over HTTPS.  
To fix this, you need to use a **Personal Access Token (PAT)** instead of your password.

**Steps to resolve:**

1. Go to [GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)](https://github.com/settings/tokens).
2. Click **Generate new token (classic)** and select the following scopes:
   - `repo`
   - `workflow` (optional, for triggering GitHub Actions)
3. Copy the generated token — you’ll only see it once.
4. Update your Git remote to include your GitHub username:
   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin https://<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>@github.com/<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>/<YOUR_REPOSITORY>.git
   ```

5. The next time you push, Git will prompt for your password — **paste the token** instead.
6. (Optional) To store credentials for future pushes:

   ```bash
   git config --global credential.helper store
   ```

After this setup, `make release` and manual pushes will work without further authentication errors.
