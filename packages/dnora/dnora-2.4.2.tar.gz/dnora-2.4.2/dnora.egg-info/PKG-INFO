```
The tool is also compatible with WEkEO Jupyter Lab, allowing seamless integration and use. For instructions on how to install dnora in WEkEO, please refer [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15MKSDBaykpkUQyKRKcCPbVlzFDf7lOIMmdjbtRQhMBc/edit?usp=drive_link).

# Alternative installation 💻

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/MET-OM/dnora.git
$ cd dnora/
$ conda config --add channels conda-forge
$ conda env create -f environment.yml
$ conda activate dnora2
$ pip install .
```
 
The latest version of the old 👴 'v1' dnora is 1.4.3, and can be installed with:

```

You can find the code of the origin dnora v1 in the branch 'v1' on GitHub. Please not that it is no longer mainained.


# What is dnora? 

dnora is a software for dynamical downscaling of wave products i.e., NORA3 wave hindcast and WW3 wave forecast from [Norwegian Meteorological Institute](https://www.met.no/) and ERA5 from [ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int/).
