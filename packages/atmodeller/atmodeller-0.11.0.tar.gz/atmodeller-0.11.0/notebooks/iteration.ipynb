    "For models that require iterative updates where constraints evolve gradually&mdash;such as during time integration or other forms of sequential solving&mdash;*Atmodeller* can be used as follows. The order of the arguments and the size of the arrays must match those used to initialise the model, although the values themselves can vary between iterations.\n",

This approach is often the most intuitive way to couple *Atmodeller* with external codes or models that provide new constraints at each step. While not always the most performant strategy, especially for large parameter sweeps or high-resolution simulations, it offers a clear and flexible mechanism for driving iterative update processes."

    "## Fully JAX compatible approach\n",
    "\n",
    "You may be thinking: \"*Atmodeller* is a JAX-compatible code, so why would I embed JAX-compiled functions inside an inefficient Python for loop?\" And you'd be absolutely right. While simple loops offer clarity, they also limit performance by forcing execution back onto the Python interpreter at every step. Instead, there is a far more optimal way to integrate an *Atmodeller* solver into a JAX workflow&mdash;one that keeps the entire update sequence within JAX’s functional, compiled execution model. By restructuring the iterative procedure into a form suitable for ``jax.lax.scan`` or similar control-flow primitives, the full computation can be jitted end-to-end, avoiding Python overhead and enabling XLA to optimise the entire sequence as a single fused computation. This approach preserves the flexibility of iterative updates while achieving JAX-level performance and full accelerator compatibility."
