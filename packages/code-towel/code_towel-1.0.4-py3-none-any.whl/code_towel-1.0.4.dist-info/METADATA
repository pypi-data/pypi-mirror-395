           TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
        
           1. Definitions.
        
              "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
              and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
        
              "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
              the copyright owner that is granting the License.
        
              "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
              other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
              control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
              "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
              direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
              otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
              outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
        
              "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
              exercising permissions granted by this License.
        
              "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
              including but not limited to software source code, documentation
              source, and configuration files.
        
              "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
              transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
              not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
              and conversions to other media types.
        
              "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
              Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
              copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
              (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
        
              "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
              submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
              designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
        
              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

# Towel

[![CI](https://github.com/ericeallen/towel/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ericeallen/towel/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/ericeallen/towel/branch/main/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/ericeallen/towel)
[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/code-towel.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/code-towel/)

**A Python tool that DRYs your code.**

Towel automatically detects and refactors violations of the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle in Python codebases using unification algorithms from automated theorem proving.

## Testing Status

- **Unit Tests**: 125/125 passing (100%)
- **Observational Equivalence**: 175/175 refactoring proposals pass automated behavioral equivalence testing
- **Test Coverage**: 18 example files with comprehensive edge cases

All refactorings are verified to behave identically to the original code through automated observational equivalence testing.

## Quick Start

The tool uses only Python stdlib with zero external dependencies.

### Using Just (Recommended)

The easiest way to use the tool is with [just](https://github.com/casey/just):

```bash
# Install just: brew install just (macOS) or cargo install just

# Preview refactoring opportunities (read-only)
just preview test_examples/

# Apply refactorings to a new directory
just dry test_examples/ cleaned_examples/

# Apply refactorings in-place (overwrites original)
just dry my_code/ my_code/

# Run tests
just test

# Check test coverage
just coverage-unification

# See all commands
just --list
```

### CLI Commands

After installation, Towel provides three main commands:

```bash
# Preview duplicates (read-only)
towel preview <file_or_directory>

# Apply refactorings
towel dry <input> <output>

# Rename extracted functions with LLM assistance
towel rename-helpers <directory>
```

### Direct Script Usage

You can also run the scripts directly without installation:

```bash
# Preview duplicates (read-only)
python3 scripts/preview <file_or_directory>

# Refactor code (writes to output location)
python3 scripts/dry <input> <output>
```

## Features

- **Zero External Dependencies**: Uses only Python standard library
- **Unification-Based Analysis**: Advanced algorithm from automated theorem proving
- **Hygienic Code Generation**: Generates functions with hygienically renamed parameters to avoid name conflicts. The generated parameter names like `__param_0` are intentionally generic and can be renamed to more meaningful names using an LLM coding assistant for better readability.
- **Referential Transparency**: Preserves referential transparency and maintains program semantics through careful scope analysis
- **Safe Refactoring**:
  - Alpha-renaming for loop variables (treats `i` and `j` as equivalent)
  - Return value propagation (detects returns anywhere in block)
  - Orphan variable detection (prevents unsafe extractions)
  - Builtin filtering (never parameterizes `len`, `print`, etc.)
  - F-string handling (correct AST manipulation)
- **Smart Parameterization**:
  - Constant parameterization (different numbers/strings become parameters)
  - Structural comparison (only extracts truly similar code)
  - Max parameter limits (prevents over-parameterization)
- **Class-Aware Method Extraction**:
  - Promotes duplicate methods into the nearest shared base class when possible
  - Preserves decorators (`@classmethod`, `@staticmethod`) and implicit binders (`self`/`cls`)
  - Rewrites call sites across files to dispatch through the new helper correctly
  - Falls back gracefully when no safe shared ancestor exists
- **Cross-File Support**: Automatically handles duplicates spanning multiple files
- **Comprehensive Testing**:
  - 175/175 refactoring proposals pass observational equivalence testing
  - 125 unit tests passing (100%)
  - Automatic observational equivalence testing verifies refactored code behaves identically to original
  - Tests 175 refactoring proposals across 18 example files automatically
  - Intelligent test input generation based on AST analysis
  - Recursive testing of returned functions (closures)
  - See `tests/OBSERVATIONAL_EQUIVALENCE.md` for details

## Installation

### For Users

```bash
# Install from PyPI (zero external dependencies)
pip install code-towel

# Or install from source
git clone https://github.com/ericeallen/towel.git
cd towel
pip install -e .
```

### For Developers

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install with dev dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Alternatively, install the specific tools you need
pip install black flake8 mypy coverage
```

### Optional: Enhanced Progress Bars

For nicer progress bars during analysis, you can optionally install `tqdm`:

```bash
pip install tqdm
```

Without `tqdm`, Towel still works perfectly with zero dependencies - it just uses simpler progress indicators.

## Usage

### Preview Mode (Read-Only)

Preview refactoring opportunities without modifying files:

```bash
# Preview a single file
python3 preview.py my_code.py

# Preview a directory
python3 preview.py src/
```

### Refactoring Mode

Apply refactorings to code:

```bash
# Refactor to a new location (safe - doesn't overwrite)
python3 dry.py src/ src_refactored/

# Refactor a single file
python3 dry.py my_code.py my_code_clean.py

# Refactor in-place (overwrites original)
python3 dry.py src/ src/
python3 dry.py src/ src/ --progress detail --max-iterations 0  # verbose unlimited
python3 dry.py src/ src/ --progress none --max-iterations 100  # quiet capped
```

### Examples

Preview duplicates in test examples:

```bash
just preview test_examples/
```

Refactor a project to a new location:

```bash
just dry my_project/ my_project_refactored/
```

Test the tool with coverage:

```bash
just coverage-unification
```

### Renaming Extracted Helpers with LLM Assistance

After running the DRY tool, extracted functions are named `__extracted_func_*` with generic parameter names like `__param_0`. Towel includes an interactive tool that uses LLM assistance to rename these into meaningful, human-readable names:

```bash
# Interactive mode: Generate LLM prompt and apply suggestions
towel rename-helpers src/

# List all extracted helpers
towel rename-helpers src/ --list

# Apply renamings from a JSON file
towel rename-helpers src/ --rename-file renames.json

# Dry run (preview only)
towel rename-helpers src/ --dry-run

# Limit to specific files or functions
towel rename-helpers src/ --file mymodule.py
towel rename-helpers src/ --function __extracted_func_7
```

#### How It Works

The `rename-helpers` command works in two modes:

**1. Interactive Mode (default):**
- Analyzes all `__extracted_func_*` functions in your code
- Generates a prompt showing each function's code
- You paste this prompt into Claude Code, ChatGPT, or any LLM
- The LLM suggests meaningful names based on what each function does
- You paste the LLM's JSON response back
- Towel automatically renames all references throughout your codebase

**2. File Mode (`--rename-file`):**
- Provide a JSON file mapping old names to new names
- Towel applies these renamings across your entire codebase

Example workflow:
```bash
# Run the refactoring tool
towel dry src/ src_cleaned/

# Use LLM to rename extracted functions
towel rename-helpers src_cleaned/
# (Follow the interactive prompts to get LLM suggestions)
```

The tool uses smart regex-based renaming to update all function definitions and calls throughout your project.

## How It Works

The tool uses **unification** from automated theorem proving to detect and parameterize duplicates:

1. **Parsing**: Parses Python files into ASTs using the `ast` module
2. **Block Extraction**: Extracts all contiguous code blocks from functions
3. **Unification**: Uses a nominal unification algorithm to find blocks that can be unified:
   - Matches AST structure recursively
   - Allows alpha-renaming of loop variables (`i` ≈ `j`)
   - Parameterizes differing constants and expressions
   - Respects Python builtin names and scoping rules
4. **Orphan Detection**: Validates that extraction won't create undefined variable references
5. **Function Extraction**: Generates hygienically-renamed extracted functions
6. **Replacement Generation**: Creates function calls with correct parameter order
7. **Cross-File Support**: Handles duplicates across multiple files with import generation

## Safety Guarantees

The tool ensures safe refactorings by:

- **Orphan Variable Detection**: Never extracts code that binds variables used later
- **Return Value Propagation**: Detects return statements anywhere in block
- **Alpha-Renaming**: Treats loop variables `i`, `j`, `k` as equivalent binding constructs
- **Builtin Filtering**: Never parameterizes Python builtins (`len`, `print`, `range`, etc.)
- **F-String Handling**: Correct AST manipulation for f-strings (never parameterizes literal parts)
- **Comprehension Scoping**: Respects that comprehension variables are local to the comprehension
- **Structural Similarity**: Only unifies blocks with >60% structural similarity

## Advanced Features

**Class-Aware Helper Promotion** – Duplicate instance, class, or static methods are automatically lifted into their nearest shared base class, even across different files:

- Builds an inheritance table while scanning the project
- Chooses the most specific shared ancestor for the extracted helper
- Preserves method semantics (decorators, implicit parameters, and call dispatch)
- Emits the helper in the ancestor class and rewrites original methods to dispatch through it, inserting imports only when needed

**Orphan Variable Detection** – Prevents unsafe extractions that would create undefined variables:
```python
# Rejects this unsafe extraction:
def compute():
  x = 10
  y = 20
  total = x + y
  return total  # Would leave 'total' undefined if lines 1-3 extracted alone
```

**Return Value Propagation** – Detects returns anywhere in code blocks:
```python
# Correctly generates: return extracted_func()
if x > 100:
  return y * 2  # Nested return automatically detected
```

**Alpha-Renaming for Loop Variables** - Treats `i`, `j`, `k` as equivalent binding variables:
```python
for i in range(10):  # Unifies with
for j in range(10):  # this block
```

### Progress & Iteration Feedback

The directory fixed-point refactoring loop supports progress modes via `--progress`:

| Mode    | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `tqdm`  | Rich progress bar (applied count + queued proposals). |
| `auto`  | Attempts `tqdm`; falls back to single-line textual bar. |
| `none`  | Suppresses progress output (quiet / CI). |
| `detail`| Verbose: lists discovered proposals (first 25) and localized follow-ups. |

`refactor_directory_to_fixed_point` returns `(results_dict, termination_reason)` where `termination_reason` is `fixed_point` (no proposals remain) or `iteration_cap` (stopped due to `--max-iterations N`). Use `--max-iterations 0` (default) for unlimited iterations until a fixed point.

[towel] Analyzing 26 file(s)...
[towel] Discovered 128 proposal(s)
  1. Extract common code from state_machine_pattern_v1 and state_machine_pattern_v2
  2. Extract common code from deeply_nested_computation_v1 and deeply_nested_computation_v2
  ...
```

Localized follow-ups: after each applied proposal the engine re-analyzes only changed files and prepends new opportunities to the queue for faster chained extraction.

## Testing

### Observational Equivalence Testing

Towel includes **automatic observational equivalence testing** that verifies refactored code behaves identically to the original:

```bash
# Run observational equivalence tests
just test-observational

# Run comprehensive automatic tests on all 18 example files
python -m unittest tests.test_observational_equivalence.TestAutomaticObservationalEquivalence -v
```

**Features:**
- **175/175 proposals pass (100%)** across **18 example files**
- No manual test configuration needed - extracts function names from proposals
- Intelligent test input generation using AST analysis:
  - Detects tuple unpacking: `for a, b in pairs:` → generates `[('a', 1), ('b', 2)]`
  - Detects dictionary access: `data['key']` → generates `{'key': 'value'}`
  - Uses type annotations and parameter name heuristics
- Recursive testing: When functions return functions (closures), tests the returned functions for behavioral equivalence
- **100% success rate** - all refactorings preserve program behavior

See `tests/OBSERVATIONAL_EQUIVALENCE.md` for complete documentation.

### Unit Tests

Run the comprehensive unit test suite:

```bash
# Run all 125 unit tests (100% passing)
just test

# Run with coverage
just coverage-unification

# Generate HTML coverage report
just coverage-html

# Test specific aspects
just test-bindings    # Binding constructs (for loops, comprehensions)
just test-returns     # Return value propagation
just test-fstrings    # F-string handling
just test-orphans     # Orphan variable detection
just test-engine      # End-to-end refactoring

### Fast Smoke Suite

During inner-loop development you can run a curated fast subset (proposal generation, stability, and observational equivalence on representative examples) instead of the full suite:

```bash
just test-smoke
```

Use this for quick validation (< a few minutes). Run the full suite (`just test` or `just test-all`) before pushing or releasing.

## Examples

The `test_examples/` directory contains examples with DRY violations:

- `example1_simple.py`: Simple repeated validation logic
- `example4_complex.py`: Complex data processing loops
- `bindings_for_loops.py`: Loop variable edge cases
- `bindings_comprehensions.py`: List/dict/set comprehensions
- `return_values.py`: Return value propagation scenarios
- `fstrings_constants.py`: F-string and constant handling

## Python API - Unification-Based Approach

The tool uses a unification-based approach for principled refactoring:

```python
from towel.unification.refactor_engine import UnificationRefactorEngine

# Create engine
engine = UnificationRefactorEngine(
    max_parameters=5,  # Max parameters for extracted functions
    min_lines=4        # Minimum lines for code blocks
)

# Analyze entire directory (finds cross-file duplicates)
proposals = engine.analyze_directory("src/")

# Apply refactorings
for proposal in proposals:
    modified_files = engine.apply_refactoring_multi_file(proposal)
    for file_path, content in modified_files.items():
        with open(file_path, 'w') as f:
            f.write(content)
```
