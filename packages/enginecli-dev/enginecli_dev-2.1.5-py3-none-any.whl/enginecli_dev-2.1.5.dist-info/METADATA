## The Problem with AI Coding Tools

GitHub Copilot and Cursor are great for autocomplete, but they:
- ❌ Generate code that doesn't fit your codebase
- ❌ Require you to manually verify everything
- ❌ Can't be rolled back when things break
- ❌ Don't understand your project structure

**Engine is different.** It indexes your codebase, verifies its own output, and lets you instantly rollback if needed.

### Guided Task Selection
> Run `engine generate` without arguments for smart suggestions based on your project type.

### Self-Verifying Code Generation
> Engine uses tools to check existing files, validate signatures, and lint code before applying.

### Instant Rollback
> Every generation creates a snapshot. One command to undo.

## ⚡ Quick Start

```bash
# Install
pip install enginecli-dev

# Start free trial (5 generations)
engine license trial your@email.com

# Index your project
cd your-project
engine index

# Generate your first feature
engine generate "Add JWT authentication with login and register endpoints"
```

**That's it.** Engine will:
1. Analyze your codebase structure
2. Generate files that match your patterns
3. Verify the code compiles and fits
4. Create a rollback snapshot
5. Apply the changes

---

## 🔥 Features

### 🎯 Context-Aware Generation
Engine indexes your codebase and understands your:
- File structure and naming conventions
- Existing models, services, and routes
- Import patterns and dependencies
- Code style and formatting

```bash
engine index              # Index your project
engine generate "..."     # Generations follow your patterns
```

### 🛡️ Self-Verifying Code
Before applying changes, Engine:
- ✅ Checks if referenced files exist
- ✅ Validates function signatures
- ✅ Lints generated code
- ✅ Ensures imports resolve

```
[🔧 check_file_exists] → ✓ File EXISTS: models/user.py
[🔧 get_function_signature] → Found: def create_user(...)
[🔧 lint_code] → ✓ Python syntax is valid
```

### ⏪ Instant Rollback
Every generation creates a snapshot. If something breaks:

```bash
engine rollback last      # Undo last generation
engine rollback list      # See all snapshots
engine rollback <id>      # Rollback to specific point
```

### 📊 Usage Tracking
See your generation usage after every command:

```
✓ Generated 8 file(s) (verified with 3 tool calls)
📊 Trial: 3/5 generations (2 remaining)
```

### 🚀 Guided Onboarding
Not sure what to build? Run without arguments:

```bash
engine generate

🚀 What would you like to build?

  1  🔐  Add JWT authentication with login/register endpoints
  2  📦  Create a new model with full CRUD API endpoints
  3  💳  Add Stripe payment webhook handler
  4  🛡️  Add rate limiting middleware
  5  🧪  Create comprehensive tests for existing endpoints

  c     ✏️   Enter custom task
```

## 🤔 FAQ

**Q: How is this different from ChatGPT or other AI assistants?**
> Engine indexes your codebase first, so it generates code that actually fits your project. It also verifies its output and provides instant rollback.

**Q: Does it work with my existing project?**
> Yes! Run `engine index` in any Python or TypeScript project. Engine will learn your patterns.

**Q: What if it generates bad code?**
> Every generation creates a snapshot. Run `engine rollback last` to instantly undo.

**Q: Do I need an API key?**
> No. Engine uses our hosted API. You just need a license key (free trial available).
