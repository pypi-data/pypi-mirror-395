    Convert branch name to safe directory name.

    Handles branch names with slashes (feat/auth), special characters,
    and other filesystem-unsafe characters.

    Strategy:
    1. Replace forward slashes with hyphens (feat/auth -> feat-auth)
    2. Replace other unsafe characters with hyphens
    3. Collapse multiple consecutive hyphens
    4. Strip leading/trailing hyphens
    5. Ensure result is not empty

    Examples:
        feat/auth -> feat-auth
        bugfix/issue-123 -> bugfix-issue-123
        feature/user@login -> feature-user-login
