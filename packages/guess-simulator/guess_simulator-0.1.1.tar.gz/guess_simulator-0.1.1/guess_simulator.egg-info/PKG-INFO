## 🎮 Gameplay

When you start a game, you'll see:

```
============================================================
🎮 PROBABILITY-GUIDED NUMBER GUESSING SIMULATOR
============================================================
Difficulty: MEDIUM
Range: 1 - 100
Maximum Attempts: 10
Game ID: a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890
============================================================

Enter your guess (1-100): 50
📉 Too high! Try a lower number.
📊 Attempts: 1/10

Enter your guess (1-100): 25
📈 Too low! Try a higher number.
💡 Hint: ♨️ Hot! The number is between 26 and 49.
📊 Attempts: 2/10
```

### Hint System

The game provides intelligent hints based on:

1. **Temperature Feedback**: 
   - 🔥 Very Hot (within 10% of range)
   - ♨️ Hot (within 25% of range)
   - 🌡️ Warm (within 50% of range)
   - ❄️ Cold (within 75% of range)
   - 🧊 Very Cold (beyond 75% of range)

2. **Probability-Based Range Narrowing**:
   - When possible numbers drop below threshold, shows exact range
   - Displays remaining possibilities in verbose mode

## ⚙️ Configuration

Configuration is hardcoded in `config.py` with the following profiles:

### Difficulty Profiles

| Profile | Range | Max Attempts | Hint Frequency |
|---------|-------|--------------|----------------|
| Easy    | 1-50  | 15           | Every 2 guesses |
| Medium  | 1-100 | 10           | Every 3 guesses |
| Hard    | 1-200 | 8            | Every 4 guesses |
| Expert  | 1-500 | 12           | Every 5 guesses |

### Storage Settings
- `format`: json (default for easy debugging)
- `data_dir`: Directory for storing game data (default: game_data)

## 📊 Game Statistics

The game tracks comprehensive statistics:

- Total games played
- Win/loss counts and percentages
- Average attempts per game
- Best and worst scores
- Guess history for each game

### Data Format

Games are stored in JSON format:
```json
{
  "game_id": "uuid",
  "start_time": "2025-11-29T15:30:45",
  "end_time": "2025-11-29T15:32:10",
  "duration_seconds": 85.5,
  "min_number": 1,
  "max_number": 100,
  "target_number": 42,
  "max_attempts": 10,
  "attempts": 7,
  "guess_history": [50, 25, 37, 43, 40, 41, 42],
  "won": true,
  "finished": true
}
```

## 🧪 Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
# Run all tests
python -m unittest discover tests

# Run specific test module
python -m unittest tests.test_game

# Run with verbose output
python -m unittest discover tests -v
```

**Test Suite**: 18 streamlined tests covering all core functionality

### Test Coverage
- **Unit Tests**: Game logic, validation, storage
- **Integration Tests**: Complete workflows and system integration
- All tests run in ~0.1 seconds

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Command not found after installation
```bash
# Solution: Use Python module syntax
python -m guess_simulator.cli play
```

**Issue**: Permission denied when saving
```bash
# Solution: Check directory permissions
chmod 755 game_data/
```

**Issue**: Corrupted data file
```bash
# Solution: Delete the corrupted file to start fresh
# Data files are located in game_data/ directory
```

## 📝 Design Trade-offs

### Storage Format
- **Choice**: JSON for primary storage
- **Rationale**: Human-readable, easy debugging, excellent for learning
- **Trade-off**: Slightly larger file size vs binary formats
- **Benefit**: Students can open and inspect data files directly

### Probability Algorithm
- **Choice**: Simple Bayesian range narrowing
- **Rationale**: Easy to understand for 1st-year students
- **Trade-off**: Not as sophisticated as ML models
- **Benefit**: Fast, deterministic, explainable

### Testing Approach
- **Choice**: Focused test suite (18 tests)
- **Rationale**: Covers core functionality without overwhelming complexity
- **Trade-off**: Fewer edge cases tested
- **Benefit**: Easy to understand and maintain for beginners

## 🚨 Limits and Edge Cases

### Input Limits
- **Number Range**: 1 to 2,147,483,647 (max int)
- **Max Attempts**: 1 to 1000
- **String Length**: 100 characters max

### Edge Cases Handled
- ✅ Corrupted data files (graceful error handling)
- ✅ Concurrent access (atomic writes)
- ✅ Invalid user input (strict validation)
- ✅ Missing configuration (defaults provided)
- ✅ Disk full (graceful error handling)
- ✅ Large datasets (tested with 10,000+ games)

### Known Limitations
- Windows: File rename not truly atomic (mitigated with temp files)
- Large ranges (>1M): Probability tracking uses significant memory
- Single-threaded: No async processing (keeps code simple)
