# agex: Library-Friendly Agents

**`agex`** (a portmanteau of **age**nt **ex**ecution) is a Python-native agentic framework that enables AI agents to work directly with your existing libraries and codebase.

**This works because** `agex` agents can accept and return complex types like `pandas.DataFrame` and `plotly.Figure` objects without intermediate JSON serialization. For a deeper dive, check out the full **[agex101.ipynb tutorial](https://ashenfad.github.io/agex/examples/agex101/)** or see **[geospatial routing with OSMnx](https://ashenfad.github.io/agex/examples/routing/)** for advanced multi-library integration.

For a full demo app where agex integrates with NiceGUI, see [`agex-ui`](https://github.com/ashenfad/agex-ui).


## What Makes This Different

`agex` uses a subset of Python as the agent action space, executing actions in a sandboxed environment within your process. This approach avoids the complexity of JSON serialization and allows complex objects to flow directly between your code and the agent. You control exactly what functions, classes, and modules are available, creating a safe and focused
environment for the agent.

-   **Code-as-Action**: Secure, sandboxed Python execution for agents.
-   **Library Integration**: Use your existing code directly, no tool-making required.
-   **Workspace Persistence**: Git-like versioning for agent state and memory.
-   **Multi-Agent**: Orchestrate agents with natural Python control flow.
-   **Event Streams**: Real-time, notebook-friendly observability.
-   **Benchmarking**: A framework for data-driven agent evaluation.

## Installation

Install agex with your preferred LLM provider:

```bash
# Install with a specific provider
pip install "agex[openai]"        # For OpenAI models
pip install "agex[anthropic]"     # For Anthropic Claude models
pip install "agex[gemini]"        # For Google Gemini models

# Or install with all providers
pip install "agex[all-providers]"
```

## Project Status

> **⚠️** `agex` is a new framework in active development. While the core concepts are stabilizing, the API should be considered experimental and is subject to change.

For teams looking for a more battle-tested library built on the same "agents-that-think-in-code" philosophy, we highly recommend Hugging Face's excellent [`smolagents`](https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents) project. `agex` explores a different architectural path, focusing on deep runtime interoperability and a secure, sandboxed environment for direct integration with existing Python libraries.
