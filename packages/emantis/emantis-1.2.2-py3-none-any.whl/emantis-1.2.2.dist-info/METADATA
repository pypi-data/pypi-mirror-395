e-MANTIS: Emulator for Multiple observable ANalysis in extended cosmological TheorIeS
=====================================================================================

.. contents:: Table of Contents
   :local:

Description
-----------

e-MANTIS is a python package containing emulators providing theoretical predictions for the nonlinear large-scale structure formation in the context of alternative dark energy and gravity theories.
It uses Gaussian processes to perform a fast and accurate interpolation between the outputs of high resolution cosmological :math:`N`-body simulations.
The emulator supports multiple cosmological models and observables.
It is divided in multiple modules, each one focusing on a particular type of observable.
Currently, e-MANTIS provides emulators for the following quantities:

* Matter power spectrum boost in f(R) gravity, described in: `The e-MANTIS emulator: fast predictions of the nonlinear matter power spectrum in f(R)CDM cosmology <https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08899>`_.

* Halo mass function in f(R)CDM and wCDM cosmologies, described in: `The e-MANTIS emulator: fast and accurate predictions of the halo mass function in f(R)CDM and wCDM cosmologies <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.05226>`_.

Please cite the corresponding papers if you use e-MANTIS in your work.

This project is under constant development.
More observables and cosmological models will be added in the future. Stay tuned!

Installation
------------

You can install the python package from `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/emantis/>`_ via pip::

  pip install emantis

Or you can directly clone our public `repository <https://gitlab.obspm.fr/e-mantis/e-mantis>`_ and install it from source::

  git clone https://gitlab.obspm.fr/e-mantis/e-mantis.git
  cd e-mantis
  pip install [-e] .

It requires a python version >= 3.10.

Post-installation
-----------------

The emulators shipped with e-MANTIS need to be trained before they can provide predictions.
This will be done automatically and on-the-fly the first time you use each emulator.

Alternatively, we provide a CLI utility to train all emulators at once::

  emantis-train

This should not take more than a couple of minutes.

The trained emulators are saved to disk, using the pickle protocol, ready for future usage.
Major changes in the versions of python, e-MANTIS, or some of its main dependencies, such as numpy, scipy, or scikit-learn, might break the compatibility with previously trained emulators.
In such case, the emulators will be retrained automatically on-the-fly.
You can also retrain them manually using the CLI utility.

Documentation and usage
