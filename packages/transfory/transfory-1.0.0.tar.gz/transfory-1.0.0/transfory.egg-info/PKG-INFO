**An Object-Oriented, Explainable Data Transformation Toolkit for Python.**

`Transfory` is a data preprocessing library designed with clarity and modularity in mind. Inspired by `scikit-learn`'s API, it provides a suite of common data transformation tools that can be easily combined into powerful, reusable pipelines.

What makes `Transfory` unique is its built-in **`InsightReporter`**, an explainability engine that provides detailed, human-readable logs of every step in your transformation process. No more black boxes—understand exactly what happens to your data.

## Key Features

*   **Modular Transformers**: A collection of intuitive, single-purpose transformers for common preprocessing tasks.
*   **Powerful Pipelines**: Chain transformers together with `Pipeline` and apply different logic to different columns with `ColumnTransformer`.
*   **Explainability First**: The `InsightReporter` gives you a step-by-step narrative of your data's journey, making debugging and validation effortless.
*   **Pandas-Native**: Built to work seamlessly with pandas DataFrames.

## Installation

You can install `Transfory` directly from PyPI:

```bash
pip install transfory
```

## Quick Start

Let's perform a simple data cleaning operation on the Titanic dataset and see what `Transfory` tells us.

```python
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
from transfory.pipeline import Pipeline
from transfory.missing import MissingValueHandler
from transfory.encoder import Encoder
from transfory.scaler import Scaler
from transfory.insight import InsightReporter

# 1. Load data and initialize the reporter
df = sns.load_dataset('titanic')[['age', 'fare', 'embarked', 'sex']]
reporter = InsightReporter()

# 2. Define a multi-step pipeline
pipeline = Pipeline(
    steps=[
        ("imputer", MissingValueHandler(strategy="mean")),
        ("encoder", Encoder(method="onehot")),
        ("scaler", Scaler(method="zscore"))
    ],
    logging_callback=reporter.get_callback()
)

# 3. Fit and transform the data
transformed_df = pipeline.fit_transform(df)

print("Transformed Data:")
print(transformed_df.head())

# 4. Review the Insight Report for a step-by-step explanation
print("\n--- Insight Report ---")
print(reporter.summary())
```

The `InsightReporter` will output a clear summary of what happened, such as the value used for imputation, the new columns created by the encoder, and the columns that were scaled.

## Core Modules Explained

`Transfory` is built on a set of core components that can be mixed and matched to create any preprocessing workflow.

### Orchestrators

These modules are used to control the flow and application of transformers.

#### `Pipeline`

Sequentially applies a list of transformers. The output of one step becomes the input to the next, making it easy to define an ordered workflow.

```python
from transfory.pipeline import Pipeline

pipeline = Pipeline([
    ("imputer", MissingValueHandler()),
    ("scaler", Scaler()),
])
```

#### `ColumnTransformer`

Applies different transformers to different columns of a DataFrame in parallel. This is highly efficient and essential for workflows where numeric and categorical data need separate handling.

```python
from transfory.column_transformer import ColumnTransformer

preprocessor = ColumnTransformer(
    transformers=[
        ("numeric_scaler", Scaler(), ['age', 'fare']),
        ("categorical_encoder", Encoder(), ['embarked', 'sex'])
    ],
    remainder='passthrough' # Keep other columns
)
```

#### `InsightReporter`

The explainability engine of `Transfory`. It captures events from all transformers in a pipeline and provides a detailed, human-readable summary of the entire process. Simply create an instance and pass its callback to your pipeline.

```python
from transfory.insight import InsightReporter

reporter = InsightReporter()
pipeline = Pipeline([...], logging_callback=reporter.get_callback())
pipeline.fit_transform(df)
print(reporter.summary())
```

---

### Data Transformers

These are the building blocks that perform the actual data transformations.

#### `MissingValueHandler`

Handles missing (`NaN`) values in a DataFrame.

*   **Strategies**: `mean`, `median`, `mode`, `constant` (with `fill_value`).

```python
from transfory.missing import MissingValueHandler

# Impute with the mean for numeric columns and mode for categorical
imputer = MissingValueHandler(strategy="mean")
```

#### `Encoder`

Converts categorical columns into a numerical format.

*   **Methods**: `onehot` (creates binary columns), `label` (assigns a unique integer to each category).

```python
from transfory.encoder import Encoder

# Create new columns for each category
encoder = Encoder(method="onehot")
```

#### `Scaler`

Scales numeric features to a common range.

*   **Methods**: `zscore` (standard scaling), `minmax` (scales to a [0, 1] range).

```python
from transfory.scaler import Scaler

# Scale features to have zero mean and unit variance
scaler = Scaler(method="zscore")
```

#### `OutlierHandler`

Caps extreme values (outliers) to mitigate their effect on downstream models.

*   **Methods**: `iqr` (caps at 1.5 * Interquartile Range), `zscore` (caps at a z-score threshold), `quantile`.

```python
from transfory.outlier import OutlierHandler

# Cap values outside the 1.5 * IQR range
outlier_handler = OutlierHandler(method="iqr")
```

#### `DatetimeFeatureExtractor`

Creates new features from datetime columns, such as year, month, day, or day of the week.

```python
from transfory.datetime import DatetimeFeatureExtractor

# Extract year and month from a 'transaction_date' column
date_extractor = DatetimeFeatureExtractor(features=['year', 'month'])
```

#### `FeatureGenerator`

Automatically creates polynomial and interaction features from numeric columns to help models capture non-linear relationships.

```python
from transfory.featuregen import FeatureGenerator

# Create quadratic features (e.g., a^2, b^2) and interaction features (a*b)
feature_gen = FeatureGenerator(degree=2, include_interactions=True)
```
