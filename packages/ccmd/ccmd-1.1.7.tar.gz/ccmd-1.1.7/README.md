> **Cross-platform command enhancer for humans.**
> Replace long, repetitive terminal syntax with short, intuitive commands.
> Works on **Linux**, **Windows PowerShell**, and **WSL** — safe, rollback-ready, and open source.

> **🔧 New in v1.1.6:** Bug Fix Release! Fixed critical argument passing bug and command chaining password bypass. Commands like `sudo apt update` now work correctly.

> **🔒 v1.1.5:** Advanced Security Release! Internal flag protection, atomic shell writes, path diagnostics, threat model documentation, and automated dependency scanning. [See Security Report](SECURITY_CHANGELOG.md)

> **🛡️ v1.1.4:** Security Hardening Release! 0 HIGH vulnerabilities, comprehensive security audit, automated scanning, and professional security documentation.

> **⚠️ Important:** CCMD is a powerful tool that sits between your shell and you. Like electricity or any powerful tool, **it can be dangerous if used wrongly**. Please read the [Security Policy](SECURITY.md) and [Threat Model](THREAT_MODEL.md) before using CCMD. Use carefully, cautiously, and responsibly.

> **📌 Version Notice:** We **strongly recommend using v1.1.5 or later**. This version includes critical security enhancements and passes all automated security scans with comprehensive threat model documentation. [Upgrade now](https://github.com/Wisyle/ccmd/releases/latest) — it's safe, fast, and backward compatible!

## 🧩 Overview

**CCMD** is an open-source project developed by **De Catalyst (Wisyle)**.  
It lets you define simple, natural shortcuts for everyday shell operations — no more typing endless flags or remembering weird syntax.

Instead of typing:
```bash
cd ~/Downloads
git add .
git commit -m "update"
git push
````

You can just write:

```bash
go downloads
push
```

CCMD handles the rest. It safely installs into your shell profile, manages custom commands through YAML, and supports plugins, system monitoring, and SSH management.

## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites

* Python **3.7+**
* pip (usually included with Python)

### Method 1: Install from PyPI (Recommended) ⭐

**The easiest way to install CCMD:**

```bash
pip install ccmd
```

That's it! CCMD is now available as the `ccmd` command globally.

**Test installation:**
```bash
ccmd --version
ccmd --list
```

**Note:** PyPI installation provides the CCMD package but you may still need to run shell integration for full functionality:

```bash
ccmd --install  # Sets up shell integration (one-time setup)
```

### Method 2: Install from GitHub (For Development)

For users who want the latest development version or want to contribute:

```bash
# Clone the repository (ccmd branch)
git clone -b ccmd https://github.com/Wisyle/ccmd.git
cd ccmd

# Run the installer for your platform
# Linux/macOS/WSL:
bash setup.sh

# Windows PowerShell:
.\setup.ps1

# Reload your shell
source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc for Zsh, or restart terminal
```

### Method 3: Download Release ZIP (Offline Install)

If you don't have pip or git access:

1. **Download the latest release:**
   - Visit: https://github.com/Wisyle/ccmd/releases/latest
   - Download **Source code (zip)** under Assets
   - Or direct download: https://github.com/Wisyle/ccmd/archive/refs/tags/v1.1.4.zip

2. **Extract and install:**
   ```bash
   # Linux/macOS/WSL:
   cd /path/to/ccmd
   bash setup.sh
   source ~/.bashrc

   # Windows PowerShell:
   cd C:\path\to\ccmd
   .\setup.ps1
   . $PROFILE
   ```

### Verify Installation

After installation, test that CCMD is working:

```bash
# Check system status
ccmd --check

# List available commands
ccmd --list

# Test a command
go home
```

### Update CCMD

**If installed via PyPI (recommended):**
```bash
pip install --upgrade ccmd
```

**If installed via Git:**
```bash
cd /path/to/ccmd
git pull origin ccmd
python3 run.py --install
```

**If installed via ZIP:**
- Download the latest version from PyPI: `pip install --upgrade ccmd`
- Or download latest ZIP and reinstall

### Uninstall

**If installed via PyPI:**
```bash
pip uninstall ccmd
ccmd --restore  # Optional: restore shell config
```

**If installed via Git/ZIP:**
```bash
python3 run.py --restore  # Removes shell integration
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Default Commands

CCMD default commands are defined in `$CCMD_HOME/commands.yaml`. These are managed by CCMD and updated when you upgrade.

### Custom Commands (v1.1.0+)

Your custom commands are stored separately in:

```
~/.ccmd/custom_commands.yaml
```

**Why separate?** Your custom commands survive CCMD updates and never get overwritten.

**Create custom commands:**
```bash
add                    # Interactive command creation
```

**Remove custom commands:**
```bash
remove                 # Interactive command removal
```

**Reload after manual edits:**
```bash
reload                 # Reloads config and updates shell
```

Each command follows this format:

```yaml
mycommand:
  description: "What this command does"
  action: "the shell command to execute"
  type: custom
  interactive: false   # Set to true for commands needing user input
```

## 🧪 Testing Locally

Before global install, run:

```bash
python run.py --test
```

This simulates:

* Shell detection and rc edits
* Git and system command execution
* Rollback and uninstall checks

---

## 🧰 Example Usage

```bash
# Navigate fast
go downloads

# Push Git changes instantly
push

# Check system load
cpu

# Connect to your default server
ssh
```
