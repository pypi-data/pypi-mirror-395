## Quick Start

See [`SETUP.md`](SETUP.md) for detailed installation instructions.

### Prerequisites
- **macOS**: `brew install uv` ([Install Homebrew](https://brew.sh) first if needed)
- **Windows**: [Download uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/#__tabbed_1_2) and ensure it's in your PATH

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gim-home/studio-8-design-agent.git

   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   uv sync
   uv run playwright install chromium
   ```

3. **Configure MCP in VS Code**:
   
   Create `.vscode/mcp.json` in the project directory:
   ```json
   {
     "servers": {
       "studio-design-mcp": {
         "type": "stdio",
         "command": "uv",
         "args": ["--directory", ".", "run", "-m", "studio_design_mcp"],
         "env": {}
       }
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Open in VS Code**:
   ```bash
   code .
