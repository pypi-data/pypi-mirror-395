           1. Definitions.
        
              "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
              and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
        
              "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
              the copyright owner that is granting the License.
        
              "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
              other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
              control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
              "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
              direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
              otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
              outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
        
              "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
              exercising permissions granted by this License.
        
              "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
              including but not limited to software source code, documentation
              source, and configuration files.
        
              "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
              transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
              not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
              and conversions to other media types.
        
              "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
              Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
              copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
              (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
        
              "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
              submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
              designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
        
              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

Flexible optimization of arbitrary problems in Python.

The goal of this package is to provide advanced algorithmic support for arbitrary
optimization problems (simulations/control systems) with minimal required coding. Users
can easily connect
arbitrary evaluation functions to advanced algorithms with minimal coding with
support for multi-threaded or MPI-enabled execution.

Currenty **Xopt** provides:

- Optimization algorithms:
  - Genetic algorithms
    - `cnsga` Continuous NSGA-II with constraints
    - `nsga2` NSGA-II
  - Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithms:
    - `upper_confidence_bound` BO using Upper Confidence Bound acquisition function
      (w/ or w/o constraints, serial or parallel)
    - `expected_improvement` BO using Expected Improvement acquisition function
      (w/ or w/o constraints, serial or parallel)
    - `mobo` Multi-objective BO (w/ or w/o constraints, serial or parallel)
    - `bayesian_exploration` Autonomous function characterization using Bayesian
      Exploration
    - `mggpo` Parallelized hybrid Multi-Generation Multi-Objective Bayesian
      optimization
    - `multi_fidelity` Multi-fidelity single or multi objective optimization
    - `BAX` Bayesian algorithm execution using virtual measurements
    - BO customization:
      - Trust region BO
      - Heteroskedastic noise specification
      - Multiple acquisition function optimization stratigies
  - `extremum_seeking` Extremum seeking time-dependent optimization
  - `rcds` Robust Conjugate Direction Search (RCDS)
  - `neldermead` Nelder-Mead Simplex
- Sampling algorithms:
  - `random` Uniform random sampling
- Convenient YAML/JSON based input format
- Driver programs:
  - `xopt.mpi.run` Parallel MPI execution using this input format

Xopt does **not** provide:
- your custom simulation or experimental measurement via an `evaluate` function.


Installing Xopt
===============

Installing `xopt` from the `conda-forge` channel can be achieved by adding `conda-forge` to your channels with:

```shell
conda config --add channels conda-forge
```

Once the `conda-forge` channel has been enabled, `xopt` can be installed with:

```shell
conda install xopt
```

It is possible to list all of the versions of `xopt` available on your platform with:

```shell
conda search xopt --channel conda-forge
```


Configuring an Xopt run
===============
Xopt runs can be specified via a YAML file or dictonary input. This requires `generator`, `evaluator`, and `vocs` to be specified, along with optional general options such as `max_evaluations`. An example to run a multi-objective optimiation of a user-defined function `my_function` is:
```yaml
generator:
    name: cnsga
    population_size: 64
    population_file: test.csv
    output_path: .

evaluator:
    function: my_function
    function_kwargs:
      my_arguments: 42

vocs:
    variables:
        x1: [0, 3.14159]
        x2: [0, 3.14159]
    objectives:
        y1: MINIMIZE
        y2: MINIMIZE
    constraints:
        c1: [GREATER_THAN, 0]
        c2: [LESS_THAN, 0.5]
    constants: {a: dummy_constant}

max_evaluations: 6400
```

Xopt can also be used through a simple Python interface.
```python
import math

from xopt.vocs import VOCS
from xopt.evaluator import Evaluator
from xopt.generators.bayesian import UpperConfidenceBoundGenerator
from xopt import Xopt

# define variables and function objectives
vocs = VOCS(
    variables={"x": [0, 2 * math.pi]},
    objectives={"f": "MINIMIZE"},
)

# define the function to optimize
def sin_function(input_dict):
    return {"f": math.sin(input_dict["x"])}

# create Xopt evaluator, generator, and Xopt objects
evaluator = Evaluator(function=sin_function)
generator = UpperConfidenceBoundGenerator(vocs=vocs)
X = Xopt(evaluator=evaluator, generator=generator, vocs=vocs)

# call X.random_evaluate() to generate + evaluate 3 initial points
X.random_evaluate(3)

# run optimization for 10 steps
for i in range(10):
    X.step()

# view collected data
print(X.data)
```

Defining an evaluation function
===============
Xopt can interface with arbitrary evaluate functions (defined in Python) with the
following form:
```python
def evaluate(inputs: dict) -> dict:
    """ your code here """
```
Evaluate functions must accept a dictionary object that **at least** has the keys
specified in `variables, constants` and returns a dictionary
containing **at least** the
keys contained in `objectives, constraints`. Extra dictionary keys are tracked and
used in the evaluate function but are not modified by xopt.

Using MPI
===============
Example MPI run, with `xopt.yaml` as the only user-defined file:
```b
mpirun -n 64 python -m mpi4py.futures -m xopt.mpi.run xopt.yaml
```

Developers
==========

Clone this repository with a truncated git history (recommended):
```shell
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/xopt-org/xopt.git
```

Or, clone this repository with the full git history (> 970 MB):
```shell
git clone https://github.com/xopt-org/xopt.git
```

Create an environment `xopt-dev` with all the dependencies:
```shell
conda env create -f environment.yml
```


Install as editable:
```shell
conda activate xopt-dev
pip install --no-dependencies -e .
```

Install pre-commit hooks:
```
pre-commit install
```

The pre-commit hooks perform autoformatting and report style-compliance errors.
* [ufmt](https://pypi.org/project/ufmt/) formats files w.r.t. [black](https://github.com/psf/black) a strict style enforcer, and [μsort](https://usort.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), which sorts imports in Python modules.
* [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) confirms compliance. Occasionally black misses long-line comments/docstrings and they require manual format.

Pre-commit runs the hooks against your files. If the commit fails, correct the reported errors and then re-add the file with `git add my_file.py`.

### VSCode
The source control integration packaged with VSCode requires additional configuration. Git commands are run in the integrated terminal, which does not inherit the Python interpreter configured with the VSCode project thus breaking the pre-commit hooks. The integration terminal can be configured to use the conda Python environment by including a `.env` file in your project repository:

```
#!/usr/bin/bash
source /path/to/xopt-dev/bin/activate
```
