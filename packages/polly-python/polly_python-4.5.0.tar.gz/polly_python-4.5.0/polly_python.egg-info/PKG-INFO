# About Polly Library

This package is intended to be used by Polly users - bioinformaticians, data scientists, and life science researchers - working in drug discovery and development.

# Installation

Polly-python can be installed by running:

```python
pip install polly-python
```
 
# Key features:

* Discover biomedical datasets specific to their research requirements by querying omixatlas which have a well-defined schema and curated metadata fields. 
* Expanding the query by using ontological mappings for diseases.
* Download the datasets of interest and use them for further enrichment and analysis using other open-source bash, R and Python packages commonly used in life-science research.
* Seamlessly interact with the Schema of the OmixAtlas by using fetch, update, and post functions.
* Create new Workspaces and fetch the list of existing ones.
* Upload and Download files and folders from Workspace.
* Save dataset of interest from OmixAtlas to Workspace.

# Get Started
