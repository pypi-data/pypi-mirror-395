Installation
============
DCscope can be installed via multiple channels.

1. **Windows installer:** Download the latest version for your architecture
   (i.e. ``DCscope_X.Y.Z_win_64bit_setup.exe``) from the official
   `release page <https://github.com/DC-analysis/DCscope/releases/latest>`__. 

2. **macOS:** Download the latest version
   (``DCscope_X.Y.Z.dmg`` or ``DCscope_X.Y.Z.pkg``) from the official
   `release page <https://github.com/DC-analysis/DCscope/releases/latest>`__. 

3. **Python 3.8 with pip:** DCscope can easily be installed with
   `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/quickstart/>`__:

   .. code:: bash

       python3 -m pip install dcscope

   To start DCscope, simply run ``python3 -m dcscope``
   or ``dcscope`` in a command shell. 


Update
======
DCscope automatically searches for updates (you may opt-out via the
Help menu) and notifies the user when a new version is available.

1. **Windows installer:** The older version of DCscope will be
   automatically uninstalled when installing a new version.

2. **macOS:** The older version of DCscope will be
   automatically uninstalled when installing a new version.

3. **Python 3.8 and pip:**

   .. code:: bash

       pip install --upgrade dcscope


Supported data file formats
===========================
DCscope exclusively supports the .rtdc data file format. This file format is
based on the `HDF5 format <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_Data_Format>`_
which makes it portable, consistent, and efficient.

If you have **.tdms-based datasets** (created using antique versions of Shape-In),
you can still use the data after you have converted them to .rtdc files using
`DCKit <https://github.com/DC-analysis/DCKit/releases/latest>`_,
which provides a convenient GUI for several other RT-DC data
management tasks as well. The .rtdc file format is faster than the .tdms file
format, occupies less disk space, and consists of only one file per measurement.

If you have **raw .rtdc files** that only contain the recorded images and no
extracted events, you can perform segmentation and feature extraction using
`ChipStream <https://github.com/DC-analysis/ChipStream/releases/latest>`_.
