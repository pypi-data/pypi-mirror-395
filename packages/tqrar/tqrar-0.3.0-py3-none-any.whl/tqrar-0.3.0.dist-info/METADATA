## About

**Tqrar** (تِقرار) — meaning "conversation" or "discussion" in Arabic and Urdu — is a native JupyterLab extension that brings AI assistance directly into your data science workflow.

Unlike standalone AI tools, Tqrar integrates seamlessly into JupyterLab, adding an AI assistant panel that understands your notebook context. It can analyze code, explain errors, generate visualizations, and manipulate cells through natural language.

### What it does

- Analyzes and explains your code
- Helps debug errors with context-aware suggestions
- Generates data visualizations and analysis code
- Creates and modifies notebook cells on command
- Answers questions about your datasets and libraries

### Key capabilities

- Context-aware: Understands your active notebook and execution state
- Tool integration: Reads/writes files, creates/modifies cells, executes code
- Multiple LLM providers: Works with OpenRouter, OpenAI, Anthropic, or local models
- Streaming responses: Real-time AI interaction
- Persistent history: Conversation history saved across sessions
- Theme integration: Adapts to JupyterLab's light/dark themes

---

## Installation

### Requirements

- JupyterLab 4.0.0 or higher
- Python 3.8 or higher

### Install

```bash
pip install tqrar
```

The extension installs automatically. Launch JupyterLab and look for the AI Assistant icon in the left sidebar.

```bash
jupyter lab
```

### For Developers

If you want to contribute or modify the extension:

**Prerequisites:**
- JupyterLab >= 4.0.0
- Node.js >= 20.0.0
- Python >= 3.8

**Install from source:**

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/tqrar/tqrar.git
cd tqrar

# Install Node dependencies

## Usage

### Getting started

1. Open a notebook in JupyterLab
2. Click the AI Assistant icon in the left sidebar
3. Start chatting:
   - "Create a cell that loads a CSV file and shows the first 5 rows"
   - "Explain what this pandas groupby operation does"
   - "Why is my model overfitting?"
   - "Generate a visualization for this dataset"

### Available tools

The AI can interact with your notebooks through these tools:

Notebook operations:
- Create, update, delete, and move cells
- Merge and split cells
- View all cells in a notebook

File system operations:
- List, read, write, and delete files
- Create directories
- Navigate your workspace

Code inspection:
- Get code completions
- Access function and class documentation
- Analyze code structure
