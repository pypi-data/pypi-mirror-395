# clacks
the default mode of degenerate communication.

## Installation

**Recommended** - install globally with uv (best for use with coding agents like Claude Code, Cursor):
```bash
uv tool install slack-clacks
```

**Alternative** - run directly without installation:
```bash
uvx --from slack-clacks clacks
```

**Alternative** - works with pip, poetry, or any package manager:
```bash
pip install slack-clacks
```

## Authentication

Authenticate via OAuth:
```bash
clacks auth login -c <context-name>
```

### Authentication Modes

clacks supports three authentication modes:

**clacks mode (default)**: Full workspace access via OAuth
```bash
clacks auth login --mode clacks
```
Permissions: channels, groups, DMs, MPIMs, files, search

**clacks-lite mode**: Secure, DM-focused access via OAuth
```bash
clacks auth login --mode clacks-lite
```
Permissions: DMs, MPIMs, reactions only

**cookie mode**: Browser session authentication
```bash
clacks auth login --mode cookie
```
Extract xoxc token and d cookie from browser. No OAuth app needed. See [docs/cookie-auth.md](docs/cookie-auth.md) for extraction instructions.

Use clacks-lite for security-conscious environments where channel access isn't needed. Use cookie mode for quick testing or when OAuth is impractical. Operations requiring unavailable scopes will fail with a clear error message and re-authentication instructions.

OAuth requires HTTPS. Generate a self-signed certificate:
```bash
clacks auth cert generate
```

View current authentication status:
```bash
clacks auth status
```

Revoke authentication:
```bash
clacks auth logout
```

## Configuration

Multiple authentication contexts supported. Initialize configuration:
```bash
clacks config init
```

List available contexts:
```bash
clacks config contexts
```

Switch between contexts:
```bash
clacks config switch -C <context-name>
```

View current configuration:
```bash
clacks config info
```

## Messaging
