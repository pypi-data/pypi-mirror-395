# EXTRACTION PROCESS
Follow this step-by-step process meticulously:
1.  **Understand the Goal:** Your primary objective is to extract information from the provided text and structure it precisely according to the JSON schema.
2.  **Full Text Analysis:** Read and comprehend the entirety of the provided document(s) before initiating extraction. This helps in understanding context and relationships.
3.  **Schema Adherence:** The provided JSON schema is your definitive guide. All extracted data must conform to this schema in terms of structure, field names, and data types.
4.  **Identify Relevant Data:** Locate all data points within the text that correspond to the fields defined in the JSON schema.
5.  **Map Data to Schema:** Carefully assign the identified data to the correct fields in the schema.
6.  **Handle Ambiguity and Missing Information:**
    * If information for a field is ambiguous, use your reasoning capabilities to determine the most plausible interpretation based on the context.
    * If information for an optional field is not present, omit the field or use `null` if the schema allows.
    * For required fields, if information is genuinely missing and cannot be inferred, this is a critical issue. However, strive to find or infer it. If the schema defines a default, consider that.
7.  **Prioritize Explicit Information:** Base your extraction on information explicitly stated in the text. Avoid making assumptions unless absolutely necessary and clearly justifiable by the context.
8.  **Synthesize from Multiple Documents:** If multiple documents are provided, synthesize the information comprehensively. If conflicting information arises, prioritize what appears to be the most current, official, or reliable source. Note any significant discrepancies if the output format allows, but the primary goal is a single coherent JSON.
9.  **Data Type Conformance:** Strictly adhere to the data types specified in the JSON schema (e.g., string, number, boolean, array, object). Numbers should be formatted as numbers (e.g., `123`, `12.34`), not strings containing numbers (e.g., `"123"`). Booleans should be `true` or `false`.
10. **Nested Structures and Relationships:**
    * For nested objects or arrays, ensure your JSON output accurately reflects the hierarchical structure defined in the schema.
    * If the schema implies relationships between different entities (e.g., using foreign keys or requiring linking), ensure these are correctly represented.
    * If temporary identifiers are needed to link entities within the JSON output (e.g., for items that will later become related records in a database), generate unique and descriptive temporary IDs (e.g., "_temp_id_entityName_XYZ123"). Use these temporary IDs consistently for all references within the current JSON output.
"""

    default_extraction_guidelines = """\
# IMPORTANT EXTRACTION GUIDELINES
- **Output Format:** Your entire output must be a single, valid JSON object. Do not include any explanatory text, comments, apologies, or any other content before or after the JSON object.
- **Output Structure Mandate:** Your response MUST be a single JSON object. This object MUST have a single top-level key named "result". The value of this "result" key MUST be the JSON object that conforms to the provided JSON schema. Example: `{"result": {your_schema_compliant_object_here}}`. Do NOT use any other top-level keys. Do NOT return the schema-compliant object directly as the root.
- **Field Names:** Use the exact field names (case-sensitive) as specified in the JSON schema for the object under the "result" key.
- **Structured Elements:** Pay close attention to structured elements within the text, such as tables, lists, headings, and emphasized text, as they often contain key information.
- **Dates and Times:** Unless the schema specifies a different format, use ISO 8601 format for dates (YYYY-MM-DD) and date-times (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ).
- **Enumerations (Enums):** If a field in the schema is an enumeration with a predefined set of allowed values, ensure that the extracted value is one of those permitted values.
- **Null Values:** Use `null` for optional fields where data is not available or not applicable, provided the schema allows for null values for that field. Do not use strings like "N/A", "Not available", or empty strings "" unless the schema explicitly defines such string literals as valid values.
- **String Values:** Ensure all string values in the JSON are correctly escaped (e.g., quotes within strings).
- **Meticulousness:** Accuracy is paramount. Double-check your extracted data against the source text and the schema before finalizing your output.

# FINAL CHECK BEFORE SUBMISSION
1.  **Valid JSON?** Is the entire output a single, syntactically correct JSON object?
2.  **Output Structure Correct?** Does the output JSON object have a single top-level key named "result"?
3.  **Schema Conformity?** Does the JSON object under the "result" key strictly adhere to all aspects of the provided JSON schema (all required fields present, correct data types for all values, correct structure for nested objects and arrays)?
4.  **Field Name Accuracy?** Are all field names within the object under the "result" key exactly as specified in the schema (case-sensitive)?
5.  **Relationship Integrity?** If temporary IDs or other linking mechanisms were required within the object under the "result" key, are they used correctly and consistently?
6.  **Null Handling?** Are `null` values used appropriately for missing optional data, according to schema constraints?
7.  **No Extraneous Text?** Is there absolutely no text or characters outside of the main JSON object itself?

        "When defining fields for such table models:",
        "- **Scalar Types:** Standard types like `str`, `int`, `float`, `bool`, `datetime.datetime`, `uuid.UUID` are generally fine.",
        "- **List and Dict Types:** If a field needs to store a list (e.g., `List[str]`) or a dictionary (e.g., `Dict[str, Any]`), these cannot be directly mapped to standard SQL column types. You MUST specify how they should be stored using the `field_options_str` property for that field. The recommended way is to store them as JSON.",
        '  - **Example for `List[str]`:** For a field `tags: List[str]`, you should include this in its description object: `"field_options_str": "Field(default_factory=list, sa_type=JSON)"`',
        '  - **Example for `Dict[str, Any]`:** For a field `metadata: Dict[str, Any]`, include: `"field_options_str": "Field(default_factory=dict, sa_type=JSON)"`',
        '- **Import JSON:** If you use `sa_type=JSON` in any `field_options_str`, you MUST also add `"from sqlmodel import JSON"` to the main `imports` array in your generated JSON description.',
        "Failure to correctly define `List` or `Dict` fields for table models (by not using `field_options_str` with `sa_type=JSON` or a similar valid SQLAlchemy type) will lead to errors.",
        '- **Required Fields and Defaults:** Any field that is NOT `Optional` (e.g., `type: "str"`, `type: "int"`) is a REQUIRED field. For all required fields, you MUST provide a sensible `default` value in its description object to ensure the model can be instantiated for validation. For strings, use `""` as the default. For numbers, use `0` or `0.0`. For booleans, use `false`. Failure to provide a default for a required field will cause the system to crash.',
        "- **Relationships and Foreign Keys:** When modeling relationships (e.g., one-to-many), you must define fields for both the foreign key and the relationship itself.",
        '  - **Foreign Key Field:** The model on the "many" side of a relationship (e.g., `LineItem`) needs a foreign key field. This field MUST be defined as `Optional` with a `default` of `None` to pass validation.',
        '  - **Foreign Key Naming Consistency:** The `foreign_key` value is critical. It MUST be a string in the format `"table_name.column_name"`. The `table_name` part MUST exactly match the `table_name` defined in the parent model. For example, if the `Invoice` model has `"table_name": "invoices"`, then the foreign key in `LineItem` MUST be `"invoices.id"`. A mismatch like `"invoice.id"` will cause a crash.',
        '  - **Relationship Fields:** Both models should have a `Relationship` attribute. The "one" side gets a `List` of the "many" side, and the "many" side gets an `Optional` of the "one" side. Use `field_options_str` to define them. Example for `Invoice`: `{"name": "line_items", "type": "List[\\"LineItem\\"]", "field_options_str": "Relationship(back_populates=\\"invoice\\")"}`. Example for `LineItem`: `{"name": "invoice", "type": "Optional[\\"Invoice\\"]", "field_options_str": "Relationship(back_populates=\\"line_items\\")"}`.',
