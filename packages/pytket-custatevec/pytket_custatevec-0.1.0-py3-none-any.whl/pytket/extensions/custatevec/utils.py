INSTALL_CUDA_ERROR_MESSAGE = r"""
No installation of {} found!

`pytket-custatevec` is available for Python 3.10, 3.11 and 3.12 on Linux.
In order to use it, you need access to a Linux machine (or WSL) with an NVIDIA GPU of
Compute Capability +7.0 (check it https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus) and
have `cuda-toolkit` installed; this can be done with the command

sudo apt install cuda-toolkit

You need to install `cuquantum-python` before `pytket-custatevec`.
The recommended way to install these dependency is using conda:

conda install -c conda-forge cuquantum-python

This will automatically pull all other CUDA-related dependencies.

For more details, including how to install these dependencies via pip or how to manually specify the CUDA version,
read the install instructions in the official cuQuantum documentation https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuquantum/latest/getting-started/index.html.
