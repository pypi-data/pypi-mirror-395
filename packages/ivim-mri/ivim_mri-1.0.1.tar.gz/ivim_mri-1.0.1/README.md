The `ivim` python package provides functionality for the main steps associated with IVIM analysis of diffusion MRI data including:
- Methods for IVIM parameter estimation / model fitting
- Simulation of MRI data based on IVIM models
- Optimization of b-values 
- Preprocessing, both basic operations like extracting image data with a specific b-value or averaging of diffusion encoding directions, and specific methods like correction for signal drift

The file formats used are the ones used by [FSL](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FSL), i.e. .nii.gz for image data, .bval for b-values and .bvec for diffusion encoding directions. File with ending .cval is also used for c-values in analogy to .bval for b-values to describe flow encoding.

## Dependencies
The `ivim` python package relies heavly on numpy for numerical operations, uses nibabel for reading and writing nifti file, and uses scipy for some specific minimization/optimization tasks. A python version >= 3.10 is required.

## How to install
The suggested way to install is to first prepare an environment suitable for the `ivim` package using e.g. venv with a compatible python version (>= 3.10):

    python3 -m venv .ivim

Activate the environment:

    source .ivim/bin/activate 

To install the package, run:

    python3 -m pip install ivim-mri
