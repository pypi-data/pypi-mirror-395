               agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
               Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
               WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
               implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions

               risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
         
            8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
               whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
               unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
               negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
               liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
               incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
               result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
               Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
               work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
               other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
               has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
         
            9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
               the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,

               or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
               License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
               on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
               of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
               defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
               incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
               of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

Finds a non-euclidean distance or similarity between two strings.

Jaro and [Jaro-Winkler](https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/working-papers/1991/adrm/rr91-9.pdf) equations provide a score between two short strings where errors are more prone at the end of the string. Jaro's equation measure is the weighted sum of the percentage of matching and transposed characters from each string. Winkler's factor adds weight in Jaro's formula to increase the calculated measure when there is a sequence of characters (a prefix) in both strings.

This version is based on the [original C implementation of strcmp95](https://web.archive.org/web/20100227020019/http://www.census.gov/geo/msb/stand/strcmp.c) implementation but does not attempt to normalize homoglyph (e.g.: `O` vs. `0`).

 * Impact of the prefix is limited to 4 characters, as originally defined by Winkler.
 * Input strings are not modified beyond whitespace trimming.
 * In-word whitespace and characters case will **optionally** impact score.
 * Supports optional UTF-8 normalization and homoglyph sanitization.
 * Returns a floating point number rounded to the desired decimals (defaults to `2`) using Python's [`round`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#round).
 * Consider usual [floating point arithmetic](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/floatingpoint.html#tut-fp-issues) characteristics when working with this module.

## Implementation

The complexity of this algorithm resides in finding the `matching` and `transposed` characters. That is because of the interpretation of what are the `matching` conditions and the definition of `transposed`. Definitions of those two will make the score vary between implementations of this algorithm.

Here is how `matching` and `transposed` are defined in this module:

* A character of the first string at position `N` is `matching` if found at position `N` or within `distance` on either side in the second string.
* The `distance` is calculated using the rounded down length of the longest string divided by two minus one.
* Characters in the first string are matched only once against characters of the second string.
* Two characters are `transposed` if they previously matched and aren't at the same position in the matching character subset.
* Decimals are rounded according to the scientific method.

### Example

Calculate the Jaro Winkler similarity ($sim_{w}$) between `PENNSYLVANIA` and `PENNCISYLVNIA`:

$$
s_{1}=\text{PENNSYLVANIA} \qquad\text{and}\qquad s_{2}=\text{PENNCISYLVNIA}
$$

```
    P E N N C I S Y L V N I A
  ┌-─────────────────────────
P │ 1          ╎
E │   1          ╎
N │     1          ╎
N │       1          ╎           Symbols '╎' represent the sliding windows
S │             1      ╎        boundary in the second string where we look
Y │ ╎             1      ╎           for the first string's character.
L │   ╎             1      ╎
V │     ╎             1                   d = 5 in this example.
A │       ╎                 1
N │         ╎           1
I │           ╎           1
A │             ╎
```

$$
\begin{split}
   d &= \left\lfloor {\max(12, 13) \over 2} \right\rfloor - 1 \newline
     &= 5 \newline
\end{split}
\qquad
   \text{ and }
\qquad
\begin{split}
   |s_{1}| &= 12 \newline
   |s_{2}| &= 13 \newline
\end{split}
\qquad
   \text{ and }
\qquad
\begin{split}
   \ell &= 4 \newline
      m &= 11 \newline
      t &= 3 \newline
      p &= 0.1 \newline
\end{split}
$$

Considering the input parameters calculated above:

$$
\begin{split}
   sim_{j} &=\begin{cases}
               0 & \text{if } m = 0 \newline
               {1 \over 3} \times \left({m \over |s_{1}|} + {m \over |s_{2}|} + {{m - t} \over m} \right) & \text{otherwise}
             \end{cases} \newline
           &={1 \over 3} \times \left({11 \over 12} + {11 \over 13} + {{11 - 3} \over 11}\right) \newline
           &= 0.83003108003 \newline
\end{split}
\qquad
   \text{then}
\qquad
\begin{split}
   sim_{w} &= sim_{j} + \ell \times p \times (1 - sim_{j}) \newline
           &= 0.83003108003 + 4 \times 0.1 \times (1 - 0.83003108003) \newline
           &= 0.89801864801 \newline
\end{split}
$$

We found that the $\lceil sim_{w} \rceil$ is $0.9$.
