**Turn real conversations into insights that measurably improve your AI agents.**


Agentune Analyze & Improve helps teams discover what drives an agent’s KPIs up or down — and generate concrete recommendations to enhance performance.  
It transforms messy operational data into interpretable, data-driven actions that actually move business metrics.


---


## Why It Matters


Most AI agents are optimized by intuition: a few sample chats, some prompt edits, and best guesses.


Agentune replaces guesswork with evidence.  
Using structured and unstructured data from real conversations, it:


- Identifies **patterns** that correlate with KPI outcomes  
- Surfaces **interpretable insights** (not opaque scores)  
- Recommends **targeted changes** to prompts, policies, and logic  


No more trial-and-error tuning — just measurable improvement grounded in data.


For example: suppose you built a sales agent and now have a dataset of conversations with labeled outcomes as **win**, **undecided**, or **lost**.
Using Agentune Analyze & Improve, you can discover insights showing which patterns or intents correlate with those outcomes and receive concrete recommendations to refine the agent’s playbook — for instance, improving how it handles discounts, competitor mentions, or shipping questions.




## How It Works


Agentune Analyze & Improve follows a transparent, two-step process:


### 1. Analyze
- Ingests conversations, outcomes, and optional context data (e.g., product, policy, CRM).  
- Generates semantic and structural **features** that capture patterns in language, behavior, or flow.  
- Selects statistically significant features correlated with KPI changes — these become your **drivers** of performance.


Example insights:
- “Mentions of competitors early in chat increase conversion probability.”  
- “Discount discussion combined with shipping-time questions lowers CSAT.”  


### 2. Improve
- Maps the discovered drivers into **actionable recommendations** — changes to prompts, tool usage, escalation logic, or playbooks.  
- Outputs a ranked list of improvement opportunities, each linked to its supporting data.  


These recommendations can then be validated using [Agentune Simulate](https://github.com/SparkBeyond/agentune/blob/main/agentune_simulate/README.md) before deployment.

## Example Usage

1. **Getting Started** - [`01_getting_started.ipynb`](https://github.com/SparkBeyond/agentune/blob/main/agentune_analyze/examples/01_getting_started.ipynb) for an introductory walkthrough of library fundamentals
2. **End-to-End Script Example** - [`e2e_script_example.md`](https://github.com/SparkBeyond/agentune/blob/main/agentune_analyze/examples/e2e_script_example.md) - a runnable example executing the entire analysis workflow
3. **Advanced Examples** - [`advanced_examples.md`](https://github.com/SparkBeyond/agentune/blob/main/agentune_analyze/examples/advanced_examples.md) for customizing components, using LLM requests caching, and advanced workflows 


## Testing & Costs
We've tested Agentune Analyse with the combination of OpenAI o3 and gpt-4o-mini. In our tests, the cost per conversation was approximately 5-10 cents per conversation.


## Installation


```bash
pip install agentune-analyze
```


**Requirements**
- Python ≥ 3.12
- Note for Mac users: If you encounter errors related to lightgbm, you may need to install OpenMP first: brew install libomp. See the LightGBM macOS installation guide for details.
