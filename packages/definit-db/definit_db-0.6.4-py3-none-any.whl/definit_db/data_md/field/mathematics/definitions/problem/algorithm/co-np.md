# Co-NP


[Co-NP](mathematics/Co-NP) is a [complexity](mathematics/complexity) class in computational 
complexity theory that contains all decision [problems](mathematics/problem) whose 
[complement](mathematics/complement problem) is in [NP](mathematics/NP). A 
problem is in Co-NP if the "no" instances can be verified by a 
[deterministic Turing machine](mathematics/deterministic Turing machine) in 
[polynomial](mathematics/polynomial) [time complexity](mathematics/time_complexity). 
Equivalently, the [complement](mathematics/complement problem) of the problem can be solved by a 
[nondeterministic Turing machine](mathematics/nondeterministic Turing machine) in time 
[O(n^k)](mathematics/big_o_notation) for some constant k, where n is the size of the 
[input data](mathematics/input data). Co-NP stands for "Complement of NP."
