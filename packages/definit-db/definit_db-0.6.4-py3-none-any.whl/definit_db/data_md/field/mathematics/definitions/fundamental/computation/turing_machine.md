# Turing machine


A [Turing machine](mathematics/Turing machine) is a mathematical model of computation that defines an abstract machine. 
It consists of an infinite tape divided into cells, a head that can read and write symbols on the tape, 
a state register that stores the machine's current state, and a finite table of 
[instructions](mathematics/instruction) that determines the machine's behavior. The Turing machine 
processes input by following a [sequence](mathematics/sequence) of state transitions based on the current state 
and the symbol being read.
