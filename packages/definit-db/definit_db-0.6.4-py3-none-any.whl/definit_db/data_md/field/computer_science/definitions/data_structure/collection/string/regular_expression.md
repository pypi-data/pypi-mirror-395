# regular expression


A [regular expression](computer_science/regular expression) is a [sequence](mathematics/sequence) of 
[characters](computer_science/character_encoding) that defines a search pattern for 
[strings](computer_science/string). Regular expressions use special syntax to specify patterns, including 
literal [characters](computer_science/character_encoding), character classes, quantifiers, and anchors. They 
enable powerful text matching, searching, and manipulation operations, allowing users to find, extract, or replace text 
that matches specific patterns. For example, the pattern `[0-9]+` matches one or more digits, and `^[a-z]+$` matches 
[strings](computer_science/string) containing only lowercase letters from start to end. Regular expressions 
can also use groups and [labels](mathematics/label) to capture and reference parts of the matched text.
