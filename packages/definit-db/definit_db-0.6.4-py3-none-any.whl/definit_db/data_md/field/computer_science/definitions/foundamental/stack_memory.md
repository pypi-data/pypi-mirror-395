# stack memory


[stack memory](computer_science/stack memory) is a region of [computer memory](computer_science/computer memory) used for static [memory allocation](computer_science/memory allocation) 
during [program](computer_science/program) execution. It stores [data](computer_science/data) in a [last in first out](mathematics/last in first out) order, 
automatically allocating and deallocating memory as [functions](mathematics/function) are called and return. The stack manages local 
[variables](computer_science/variable) and function call information.
