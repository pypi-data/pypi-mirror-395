# parallelism


[parallelism](computer_science/parallelism) is a form of [concurrency](computer_science/concurrency) where multiple [operations](computer_science/operation) 
or tasks are executed simultaneously at the exact same time, typically by utilizing multiple [processors](computer_science/processor) or [cores](computer_science/core). 
Unlike [concurrency](computer_science/concurrency), which is about managing multiple tasks that may overlap in time, 
[parallelism](computer_science/parallelism) specifically requires the physical simultaneous execution of tasks. This approach enables 
[programs](computer_science/program) to achieve significant performance improvements by dividing work across multiple processing units.
