# stack overflow


[stack overflow](computer_science/stack overflow) occurs when a [program](computer_science/program) attempts to use more [stack memory](computer_science/stack memory) 
than is available. This typically happens when the [call stack](computer_science/call stack) grows too large, often due to 
excessive [function](mathematics/function) [recursion](mathematics/recursion) or allocating too many local [variables](computer_science/variable). When stack overflow occurs, 
the program usually terminates with an error.
