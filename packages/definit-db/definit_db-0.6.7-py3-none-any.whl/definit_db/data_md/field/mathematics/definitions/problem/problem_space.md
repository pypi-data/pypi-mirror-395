# problem space


[problem space](mathematics/problem space) is the [set](mathematics/set) of all possible candidates for 
[solutions](mathematics/solution) to a [problem](mathematics/problem). It represents the entire 
domain that must be searched through to find a valid or [optimal solution](mathematics/optimal_solution). 
The size of the problem space directly impacts computational efficiency, as larger problem spaces typically require 
more computational resources to explore.
