# binary_search


Binary Search is an [algorithm](mathematics/algorithm) that finds the position of a target value 
within a [sequence](mathematics/sequence) by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. 
Binary search requires the [sequence](mathematics/sequence) to be [sorted](mathematics/sorting). 
At each step it compares the target with the middle element of the interval and then continues 
the search on the left or right half, effectively using a [divide_and_conquer](mathematics/divide_and_conquer) approach.
