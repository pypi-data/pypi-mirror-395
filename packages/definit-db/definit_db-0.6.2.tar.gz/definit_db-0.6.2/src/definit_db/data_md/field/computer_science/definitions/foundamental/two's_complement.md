# two's complement


[two's complement](computer_science/two's complement) is a mathematical operation and 
[binary representation](computer_science/binary representation) method used to represent 
signed [integers](mathematics/integer) in computing. In this representation, positive 
[numbers](mathematics/number) are represented in standard binary form, 
while negative [numbers](mathematics/number) are represented by inverting all 
[bits](computer_science/bit) of their positive counterpart and adding 1. 
This method allows both positive and negative [integers](mathematics/integer) to be represented and 
enables arithmetic operations to be performed using the same hardware circuitry, making it the most common method for 
representing signed integers.
