# bucket_sort


BucketSort is a [sorting](mathematics/sorting) [algorithm](mathematics/algorithm) that distributes the elements of a 
[sequence](mathematics/sequence) into a number of buckets, sorts each bucket individually (often using 
another [algorithm](mathematics/algorithm)), and then concatenates the sorted buckets to produce the final sorted 
[sequence](mathematics/sequence). Bucket sort can be very efficient when input is uniformly distributed; 
in some cases it can achieve linear time and approach the [optimal solution](mathematics/optimal_solution) 
for specific distributions.
