# arithmetic right shift


[arithmetic right shift](computer_science/arithmetic right shift) is a [bitwise operation](computer_science/bitwise operation) 
and a variant of [right shift](computer_science/right shift) that preserves the sign 
[bit](computer_science/bit) when shifting signed [integers](mathematics/integer). 
Instead of filling the leftmost positions with zeros, it replicates the sign bit, 
maintaining the correct sign for negative numbers in [two's complement](computer_science/two's complement) 
representation. This [operation](computer_science/operation) effectively performs signed integer 
division by powers of 2.
