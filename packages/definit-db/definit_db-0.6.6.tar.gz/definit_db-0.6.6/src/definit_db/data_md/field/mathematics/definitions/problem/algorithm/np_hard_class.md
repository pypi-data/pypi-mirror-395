# NP-Hard class


[NP-Hard class](mathematics/NP-Hard class) is a class of [problems](mathematics/problem) in computational 
complexity theory that are at least as hard as the hardest problems in [NP](mathematics/NP class). 
A problem is NP-Hard if every problem in NP can be [reduced](mathematics/reduction) to it in 
[polynomial](mathematics/polynomial) [time](mathematics/time_complexity). This means that 
if we had an [algorithm](mathematics/algorithm) to solve an NP-Hard problem efficiently, we could use it to 
solve all NP problems efficiently. NP-Hard problems are not necessarily in NP themselves - they may be even 
harder, with no way to verify solutions quickly. The [reduction](mathematics/reduction) is used as a 
theoretical tool to prove hardness, not to solve problems. The size of the [input data](mathematics/input data) 
determines the complexity of solving NP-Hard problems.
