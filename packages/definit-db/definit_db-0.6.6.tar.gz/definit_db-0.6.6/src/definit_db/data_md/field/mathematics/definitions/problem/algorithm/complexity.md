# complexity


A measure of the resources required by an [algorithm](mathematics/algorithm) to solve a 
[problem](mathematics/problem), typically expressed as a [function](mathematics/function) of the input size. 
Complexity quantifies how the resource requirements grow as the input size increases, helping to evaluate 
and compare algorithm efficiency.
