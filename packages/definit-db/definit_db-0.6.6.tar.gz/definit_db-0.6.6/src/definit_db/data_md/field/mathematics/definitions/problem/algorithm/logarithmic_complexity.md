# logarithmic complexity


[logarithmic complexity](mathematics/logarithmic complexity) is a [time complexity](mathematics/time_complexity) classification where 
an [algorithm](mathematics/algorithm) performs a number of [operations](mathematics/operation) that grows 
logarithmically with the size of the [input](mathematics/input data). Expressed in 
[Big O notation](mathematics/big_o_notation) as O(log n), logarithmic complexity means that each 
[operation](mathematics/operation) reduces the [problem space](mathematics/problem space) by a constant 
factor (typically by half). This is highly efficient and commonly seen in algorithms that repeatedly divide the problem 
space. Logarithmic complexity is significantly faster than linear complexity, especially for large inputs, as doubling 
the [input](mathematics/input data) size only adds one additional [operation](mathematics/operation).
