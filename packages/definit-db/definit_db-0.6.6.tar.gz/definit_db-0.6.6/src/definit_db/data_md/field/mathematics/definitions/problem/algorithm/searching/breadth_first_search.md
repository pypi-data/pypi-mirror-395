# breadth-first search


The [breadth-first search](mathematics/breadth-first search) is an [algorithm](mathematics/algorithm) for traversing or searching 
a [graph](mathematics/graph) structure. It explores all [nodes](mathematics/node) at the current 
depth level before moving to nodes at the next depth level. The algorithm starts at a given node and 
systematically visits all neighboring nodes first, then visits all unvisited neighbors of those neighbors, 
and so on. This level-by-level exploration ensures that the shortest [path](mathematics/path) 
(in terms of number of [edges](mathematics/edge)) is found first in non-[weighted graphs](mathematics/weighted graph).
