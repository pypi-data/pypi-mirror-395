# nondeterministic Turing machine


A [nondeterministic Turing machine](mathematics/nondeterministic Turing machine) is a [Turing machine](mathematics/Turing machine) where each 
[instruction](mathematics/instruction) can have multiple possible next states and actions. Given the current 
state and the symbol being read, the machine can "choose" among several possible transitions, effectively 
exploring multiple computational paths simultaneously. This is a theoretical model that allows the machine 
to make the "right" choice at each step, making it more powerful than its deterministic counterpart for 
analyzing computational complexity.
