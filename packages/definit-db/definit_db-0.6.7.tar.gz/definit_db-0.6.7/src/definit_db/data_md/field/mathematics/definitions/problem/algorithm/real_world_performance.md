# real-world performance


The [real-world performance](mathematics/real-world performance) of an [algorithm](mathematics/algorithm) refers to its actual execution 
efficiency in practical applications, as opposed to theoretical 
[complexity](mathematics/complexity) analysis. While [time complexity](mathematics/time_complexity) 
and [space complexity](mathematics/space_complexity) provide 
[asymptotic](mathematics/asymptotic_behavior) [bounds](mathematics/bound) that describe 
how an algorithm scales, real-world performance considers the actual runtime behavior with typical 
[input data](mathematics/input data) and implementation-specific factors. An algorithm with better 
theoretical complexity may perform worse in practice, and vice versa.
