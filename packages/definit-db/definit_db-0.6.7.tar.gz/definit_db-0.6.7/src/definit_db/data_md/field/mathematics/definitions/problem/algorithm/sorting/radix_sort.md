# radix_sort


[Radix](mathematics/radix) Sort is a [sorting](mathematics/sorting) [algorithm](mathematics/algorithm) that sorts 
a [sequence](mathematics/sequence) of [integers](mathematics/integer) 
(or other [objects](mathematics/object) that can be represented by integers) by processing individual 
digits or positions of the keys, grouping elements by each digit from least significant to most (LSD) 
or most to least significant (MSD). It is a non-comparative sorting technique: instead of comparing 
elements directly, it distributes them into buckets according to the value of the current digit and then 
collects them in order. When the number of digits (or key range per digit) is bounded, radix sort can 
run in linear time with respect to the number of elements and thus approach the 
[optimal solution](mathematics/optimal_solution) 
for those inputs."
