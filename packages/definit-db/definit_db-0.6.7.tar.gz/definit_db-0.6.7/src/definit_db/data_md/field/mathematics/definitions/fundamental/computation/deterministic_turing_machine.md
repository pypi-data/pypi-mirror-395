# deterministic Turing machine


A [deterministic Turing machine](mathematics/deterministic Turing machine) is a [Turing machine](mathematics/Turing machine) where each 
[instruction](mathematics/instruction) uniquely determines the next state and action. Given the current 
state and the symbol being read, there is exactly one possible transition, making the machine's behavior 
completely predictable and reproducible.
