# off-by-one


[off-by-one](mathematics/off-by-one) is a common error in [algorithms](mathematics/algorithm) where a [loop](mathematics/loop) iterates 
one time too many or one time too few, or where an [index](mathematics/index) is off by one position. This often occurs when using 
zero-based indexing or when defining loop boundaries incorrectly. Off-by-one errors can lead to incorrect results 
or missing the first or last element of a sequence.
