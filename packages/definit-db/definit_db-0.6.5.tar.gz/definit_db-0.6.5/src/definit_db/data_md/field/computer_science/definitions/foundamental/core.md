# core


[core](computer_science/core) is an independent processing unit within a [processor](computer_science/processor) 
that can execute [instructions](mathematics/instruction) and perform [operations](computer_science/operation) 
independently of other cores. Modern processors often contain multiple cores, enabling them to execute multiple 
tasks simultaneously, which is essential for parallel computing.
