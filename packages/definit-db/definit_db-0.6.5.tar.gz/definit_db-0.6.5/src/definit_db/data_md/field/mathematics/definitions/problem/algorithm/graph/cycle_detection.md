# cycle detection


[cycle detection](mathematics/cycle detection) is an [algorithm](mathematics/algorithm) for determining whether a 
[graph](mathematics/graph) contains a [cycle](mathematics/cycle). The algorithm typically uses 
[depth-first search](mathematics/depth-first search) to traverse the graph while tracking 
visited [nodes](mathematics/node) and the current [path](mathematics/path). If a node is encountered 
that is already in the current path, a cycle has been detected. Different approaches are used for 
[directed](mathematics/directed_graph) versus undirected graphs.
