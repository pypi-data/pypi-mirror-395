# bottom_up_approach


A [algorithm](mathematics/algorithm) design approach that constructs [solutions](mathematics/solution) 
to a [problem](mathematics/problem) by first solving its smaller [subproblems](mathematics/subproblem) 
and then combining those solutions to form a solution to the original problem. The bottom-up approach often avoids 
[recursion](mathematics/recursion) by iteratively building up answers from the [base cases](mathematics/base_case).
