# P


[P](mathematics/P) is a [complexity](mathematics/complexity) class in computational 
complexity theory that contains all decision [problems](mathematics/problem) that can be solved 
by a [deterministic Turing machine](mathematics/deterministic Turing machine) in 
[polynomial](mathematics/polynomial) [time complexity](mathematics/time_complexity). 
A problem is in P if there exists an [algorithm](mathematics/algorithm) that can solve any instance of the 
problem in time [O(n^k)](mathematics/big_o_notation) for some constant k, where n is the size 
of the [input data](mathematics/input data). Problems in P are considered efficiently solvable or tractable.
