# bit manipulation


[bit manipulation](computer_science/bit manipulation) is a technique that uses [bitwise operations](computer_science/bitwise operation) to perform direct operations 
on individual [bits](computer_science/bit) or groups of bits in a [binary representation](computer_science/binary representation). 
It is commonly used in [algorithms](mathematics/algorithm) for tasks like setting, clearing, toggling, 
or checking specific bits, as well as performing efficient computations.
