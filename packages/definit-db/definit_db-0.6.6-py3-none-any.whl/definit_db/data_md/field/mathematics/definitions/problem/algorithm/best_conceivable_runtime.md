# best conceivable runtime


[best conceivable runtime](mathematics/best conceivable runtime) (BCR) is the theoretical best [time complexity](mathematics/time_complexity) 
that any [algorithm](mathematics/algorithm) could possibly achieve for solving a particular [problem](mathematics/problem). 
It represents a lower [bound](mathematics/bound) on the runtime based on the fundamental [constraints](mathematics/constraint) of the problem, 
such as the amount of [input](mathematics/input data) that must be examined or the output that must be produced. The BCR helps identify whether 
an algorithm can be further optimized or if it has already achieved the best possible performance.
