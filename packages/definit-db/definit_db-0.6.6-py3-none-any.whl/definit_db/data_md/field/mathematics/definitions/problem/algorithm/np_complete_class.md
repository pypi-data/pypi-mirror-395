# NP-Complete class


[NP-Complete class](mathematics/NP-Complete class) is a class of [problems](mathematics/problem) that are both in 
[NP](mathematics/NP class) and [NP-Hard](mathematics/NP-Hard class). A problem is 
NP-Complete if: (1) given a proposed [solution](mathematics/solution), it can be verified by a 
[deterministic Turing machine](mathematics/deterministic Turing machine) in 
[polynomial](mathematics/polynomial) [time](mathematics/time_complexity), and (2) every 
problem in NP can be [reduced](mathematics/reduction) to it in polynomial time. NP-Complete 
problems are the "hardest" problems in NP - if any NP-Complete problem can be solved efficiently, then all 
problems in NP can be solved efficiently. The size of the [input data](mathematics/input data) affects the 
computational difficulty.
