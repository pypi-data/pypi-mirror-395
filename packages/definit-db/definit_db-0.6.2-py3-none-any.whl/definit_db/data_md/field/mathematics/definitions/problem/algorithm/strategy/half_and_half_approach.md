# half_and_half_approach


A [algorithm](mathematics/algorithm) design approach that solves a [problem](mathematics/problem) by dividing it 
into two equal or nearly equal halves, solving each half independently (often using [recursion](mathematics/recursion)), 
and then combining the [solutions](mathematics/solution) from both halves. This approach is particularly 
effective for problems where the [subproblems](mathematics/subproblem) can be balanced and 
solved in parallel or sequentially with reduced [complexity](mathematics/complexity).
