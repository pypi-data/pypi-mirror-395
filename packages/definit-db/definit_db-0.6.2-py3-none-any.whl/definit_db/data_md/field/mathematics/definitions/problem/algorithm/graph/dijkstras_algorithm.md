# dijkstras_algorithm


A [greedy](mathematics/greedy_algorithm) [algorithm](mathematics/algorithm) that finds the shortest 
[paths](mathematics/path) from a single source [node](mathematics/node) to all other 
nodes in a weighted [graph](mathematics/graph) with non-negative 
[edge](mathematics/edge) weights. The algorithm maintains a set of nodes for which the shortest 
[distance](mathematics/graph_distance) from the source is known, and iteratively selects the node with 
the minimum distance to expand the set until all nodes are processed.
