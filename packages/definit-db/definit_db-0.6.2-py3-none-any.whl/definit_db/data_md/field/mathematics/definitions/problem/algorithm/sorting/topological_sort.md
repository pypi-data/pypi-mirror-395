# topological_sort


Topological Sort is a [sorting](mathematics/sorting) [algorithm](mathematics/algorithm) applied to a 
[directed acyclic graph](mathematics/directed_acyclic_graph). It produces a linear ordering 
of the graph's vertices such that for every directed edge (u, v), u comes before v in the ordering.
