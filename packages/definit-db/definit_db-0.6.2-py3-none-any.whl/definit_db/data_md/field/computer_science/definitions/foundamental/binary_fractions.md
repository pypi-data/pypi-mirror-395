# binary fractions


[binary fractions](computer_science/binary fractions) are a way to represent fractional [numbers](mathematics/number) 
using [binary representation](computer_science/binary representation). In binary fractions, 
[bits](computer_science/bit) to the right of a binary point represent negative powers of 2 
(1/2, 1/4, 1/8, etc.), similar to how digits after a decimal point in base-10 represent 
negative powers of 10. For example, the binary fraction 0.101 represents 1/2 + 0/4 + 1/8 = 5/8.
