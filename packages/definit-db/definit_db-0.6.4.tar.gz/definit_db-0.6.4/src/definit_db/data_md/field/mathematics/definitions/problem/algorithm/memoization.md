# memoization


An [optimization](mathematics/optimization) technique that stores the results of expensive [function](mathematics/function) calls 
and returns the stored result when the same inputs occur again. [memoization](mathematics/memoization) is particularly effective for 
[recursive](mathematics/recursion) [functions](mathematics/function) with [overlapping_subproblems](mathematics/overlapping_subproblems), 
where the same [subproblems](mathematics/subproblem) are computed multiple times. By storing previously 
computed [solutions](mathematics/solution), memoization significantly reduces redundant computations and 
improves performance.
