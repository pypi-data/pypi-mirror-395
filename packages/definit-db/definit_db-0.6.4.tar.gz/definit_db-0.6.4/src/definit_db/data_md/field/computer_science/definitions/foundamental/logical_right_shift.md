# logical right shift


[logical right shift](computer_science/logical right shift) is a [bitwise operation](computer_science/bitwise operation) 
and a variant of [right shift](computer_science/right shift) that always fills the 
leftmost [bits](computer_science/bit) with zeros, regardless of the sign of the 
[integer](mathematics/integer). This [operation](computer_science/operation) treats the 
[binary representation](computer_science/binary representation) as an unsigned value, 
making it suitable for unsigned integer division by powers of 2.
