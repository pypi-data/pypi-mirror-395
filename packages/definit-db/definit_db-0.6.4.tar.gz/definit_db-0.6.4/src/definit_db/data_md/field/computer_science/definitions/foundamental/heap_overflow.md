# heap overflow


[heap overflow](computer_science/heap overflow) occurs when a [program](computer_science/program) attempts to use more [heap memory](computer_science/heap memory) 
than is available. This typically happens when too much dynamic [memory allocation](computer_science/memory allocation) occurs without 
proper deallocation, or when attempting to allocate a very large amount of memory at once. When heap overflow occurs, 
the program may fail to allocate memory and typically terminates with an error.
