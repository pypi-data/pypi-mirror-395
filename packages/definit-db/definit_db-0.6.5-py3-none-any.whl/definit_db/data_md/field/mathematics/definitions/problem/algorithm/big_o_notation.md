# big_o_notation


A mathematical notation used to describe the [asymptotic_behavior](mathematics/asymptotic_behavior) of a 
[function](mathematics/function), particularly the [upper_bound](mathematics/upper_bound) of 
[time_complexity](mathematics/time_complexity) or [space_complexity](mathematics/space_complexity) as the input size grows. 
Big O notation characterizes the worst-case growth rate, allowing comparison of algorithm efficiency 
independent of implementation details.
