# complement problem


The [complement problem](mathematics/complement problem) of a decision [problem](mathematics/problem) is obtained by swapping 
the "yes" and "no" answers. If the original problem accepts a [solution](mathematics/solution) as "yes", 
the complement problem answers "no" for the same solution, and vice versa. For example, if a problem 
asks "Is this graph connected?", its complement asks "Is this graph disconnected?". The complement 
inverts the acceptance [criteria](mathematics/criterion) while keeping the same 
[input](mathematics/input data) structure.
