# call stack


[call stack](computer_science/call stack) is a region of [stack memory](computer_science/stack memory) that tracks active 
[function](mathematics/function) calls during [program](computer_science/program) execution. 
It stores [information](mathematics/information) about each function call, including where to return after 
the function completes. When a function is called, its information is added to the call stack, 
and when it returns, that information is removed.
