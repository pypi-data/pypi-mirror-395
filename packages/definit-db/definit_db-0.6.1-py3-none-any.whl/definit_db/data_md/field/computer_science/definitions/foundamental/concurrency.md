# concurrency


[concurrency](computer_science/concurrency) is the ability of a [program](computer_science/program) to execute multiple tasks or [operations](computer_science/operation) 
simultaneously or in overlapping time periods. In concurrent execution, multiple tasks make progress without necessarily 
running at the exact same instant, allowing for more efficient use of system resources and improved responsiveness. 
Concurrency enables programs to handle multiple operations such as user input or 
background processing at the same time.
