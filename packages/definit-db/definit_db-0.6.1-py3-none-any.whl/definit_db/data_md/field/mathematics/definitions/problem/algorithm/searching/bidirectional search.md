# bidirectional search


The [bidirectional search](mathematics/bidirectional search) is an [algorithm](mathematics/algorithm) for finding a [path](mathematics/path) 
between two [nodes](mathematics/node) in a [graph](mathematics/graph). It simultaneously searches 
forward from the start node and backward from the goal node, stopping when the two searches meet. This approach 
typically uses [breadth-first search](mathematics/breadth-first search) from both directions. 
By searching from both ends, the algorithm can significantly reduce the search space and find the path more 
efficiently than searching in only one direction.
