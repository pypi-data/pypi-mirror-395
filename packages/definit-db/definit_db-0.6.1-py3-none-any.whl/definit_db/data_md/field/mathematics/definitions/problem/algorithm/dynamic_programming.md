# dynamic_programming


A type of [algorithm](mathematics/algorithm) that solves a [problem](mathematics/problem) by breaking it down into 
simpler [subproblems](mathematics/subproblem) and storing their [solutions](mathematics/solution) 
to avoid redundant computations. Dynamic programming is particularly effective for problems that exhibit 
[overlapping_subproblems](mathematics/overlapping_subproblems) and [optimal_substructure](mathematics/optimal_substructure), enabling the 
construction of an [optimal solution](mathematics/optimal_solution) by reusing previously computed results.
