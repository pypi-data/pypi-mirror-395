# NP


[NP](mathematics/NP) is a [complexity](mathematics/complexity) class in computational 
complexity theory that contains all decision [problems](mathematics/problem) that can be solved 
by a [nondeterministic Turing machine](mathematics/nondeterministic Turing machine) in 
[polynomial](mathematics/polynomial) [time complexity](mathematics/time_complexity). 
Equivalently, a problem is in NP if, given a proposed [solution](mathematics/solution), there exists a 
[deterministic Turing machine](mathematics/deterministic Turing machine) that can verify the 
solution's correctness in time [O(n^k)](mathematics/big_o_notation) for some constant k, where 
n is the size of the [input data](mathematics/input data). NP stands for "Nondeterministic Polynomial time."
