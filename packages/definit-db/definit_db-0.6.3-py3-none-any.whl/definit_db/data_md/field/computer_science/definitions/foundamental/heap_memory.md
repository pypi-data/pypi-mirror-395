# heap memory


[heap memory](computer_science/heap memory) is a region of [computer memory](computer_science/computer memory) used for dynamic [memory allocation](computer_science/memory allocation) 
during [program](computer_science/program) execution. It allows [data](computer_science/data) to be allocated and deallocated 
at runtime as needed. The heap provides flexible memory management where 
memory blocks can be allocated in any order and freed in any order.
