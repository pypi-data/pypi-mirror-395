# cache


[cache](computer_science/cache) is a high-speed [computer memory](computer_science/computer memory) storage layer that temporarily 
holds frequently accessed or recently used [data](computer_science/data) to reduce access time and improve performance. 
When data is requested, the cache is checked first; if the data is found (a cache hit), it can be retrieved quickly 
without accessing slower storage. If not found (a cache miss), the data must be fetched from the original source 
and may be stored in the cache for future use.
