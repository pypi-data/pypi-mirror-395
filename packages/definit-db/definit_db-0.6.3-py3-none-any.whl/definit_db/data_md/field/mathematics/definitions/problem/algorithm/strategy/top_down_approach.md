# top_down_approach


A [algorithm](mathematics/algorithm) design approach that breaks a [problem](mathematics/problem) into smaller
[subproblems](mathematics/subproblem) and solves them using [recursion](mathematics/recursion). The top-down
approach typically stores results of subproblems when the problem exhibits 
[overlapping_subproblems](mathematics/overlapping_subproblems), avoiding redundant work and building solutions 
from those stored results.
