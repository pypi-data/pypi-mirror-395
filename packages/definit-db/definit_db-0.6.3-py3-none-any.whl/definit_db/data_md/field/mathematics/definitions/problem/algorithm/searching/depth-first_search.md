# depth-first search


The [depth-first search](mathematics/depth-first search) is an [algorithm](mathematics/algorithm) for traversing or searching 
a [graph](mathematics/graph) structure. It explores as far as possible along each [path](mathematics/path) 
before backtracking. The algorithm starts at a given [node](mathematics/node) and follows 
[edges](mathematics/edge) to visit a neighbor, then recursively visits that neighbor's unvisited neighbors, 
and so on, until it reaches a [node](mathematics/node) with no unvisited neighbors, at which point it backtracks. 
This approach goes deep into the graph structure before exploring other paths.
