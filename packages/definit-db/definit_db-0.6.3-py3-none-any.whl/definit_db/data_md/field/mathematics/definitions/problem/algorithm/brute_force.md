# brute_force


A type of [algorithm](mathematics/algorithm) that solves a [problem](mathematics/problem) by systematically checking 
all possible candidates for a [solution](mathematics/solution) until the correct one is found. Brute force algorithms 
are straightforward and guarantee finding the [optimal solution](mathematics/optimal_solution) if one exists, 
but they can be computationally expensive for large problem spaces as they do not employ any [optimization](mathematics/optimization) techniques.
