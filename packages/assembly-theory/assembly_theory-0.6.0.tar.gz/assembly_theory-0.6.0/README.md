`assembly-theory` is an open-source, high-performance library for computing *assembly indices* of molecular structures (see, e.g., [Sharma et al., 2023](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06600-9); [Walker et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2024.0367)).
It is implemented in Rust and is available as a [Rust crate](https://crates.io/crates/assembly-theory), [Python package](https://pypi.org/project/assembly-theory/), and standalone executable. 


## Getting Started

If you want to use the `assembly-theory` Rust crate in a Rust project, install as follows and refer to the [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/assembly-theory) documentation for usage examples.

```shell
cargo add assembly-theory
```

If you want to use the Python library (e.g., to take advantage of RDKit-compatible molecule loaders), install `assembly-theory` using a Python virtual environment manager of your choosing and refer to the documentation on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/assembly-theory/) for usage examples.

```shell
pip install assembly-theory   # Using pip.
pipx install assembly-theory  # Using pipx.
uv add assembly-theory        # Using uv.
```

Otherwise, clone/download this repository if you want to:

- Build and run the standalone executable
- Build and run tests and benchmarks on our reference datasets
- Build the Python package locally


### Requirements

Currently, this project only supports Unix-like systems (macOS and Linux).
Windows is supported through [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

You need Rust, installed either [using `rustup`](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) or via your system package manager of choice.
This provides the `cargo` build system and dependency manager for compilation, testing, benchmarking, documentation, and packaging.
You will also need the [clang](https://clang.llvm.org) toolkit for C/C++.


### Using the Standalone Executable

Build an optimized (release) version of the standalone executable with:

```shell
cargo build --release
```

Simply pass this executable a `.mol` file path to compute that molecule's assembly index:

```shell
./target/release/assembly-theory data/checks/anthracene.mol  # 6
```

A full list of options for returning more information or customizing the assembly index calculation procedure can be found by running:

```shell
./target/release/assembly-theory --help
```


### Tests and Benchmarks

`assembly-theory` comes with a variety of unit, integration, and documentation example tests ensuring the correct calculation of assembly indices.
To run all tests, use:

```shell
cargo test
```

We actively encourage the use of `assembly-theory` as a framework within which new algorithmic improvements can be implemented and tested.
To measure the performance of a potential improvement, we've implemented benchmarks using the [`criterion`](https://crates.io/crates/criterion) crate.
These benchmarks run assembly index calculation against reference datasets of molecules, timing only the calculation part (skipping molecule parsing, etc.).
To run all benchmarks, use:

```shell
cargo bench
```

See the [`criterion` command line options](https://bheisler.github.io/criterion.rs/book/user_guide/command_line_options.html) for details on how to run only specific benchmarks or save baselines for comparison.


### Building the Python Package Locally

We use [`pyo3`](https://crates.io/crates/pyo3) to package functionality from our Rust crate as a Python package called `assembly_theory`.
To build this package locally, first create a virtual environment for this project using a manager of your choice.
Then install [`maturin`](https://pypi.org/project/maturin/):

```shell
pip install maturin      # using pip
pipx install maturin     # using pipx
uv tool install maturin  # using uv
```

Within the virtual environment, build and install this project as a Python package:

```shell
maturin develop --release
```

Once installed, this Python package can be combined with standard cheminformatic packages like [`RDKit`](https://www.rdkit.org/docs/index.html#) to flexibly manipulate molecular representations and compute their assembly indices.

```python
import assembly_theory as at
from rdkit import Chem

# Get a mol block from a molecule's SMILES representation.
anthracene = Chem.MolFromSmiles("c1ccc2cc3ccccc3cc2c1")
anthracene = Chem.MolToMolBlock(anthracene)

# Calculate the molecule's assembly index.
at.index(anthracene)  # 6
```

See the [`assembly_theory::python` documentation](https://docs.rs/assembly-theory/latest/assembly_theory/python) for a complete list of functions exposed to the Python package along with usage examples.

To run the Python test suite, install [`pytest`](https://pypi.org/project/pytest/) in your virtual environment as follows and then simply run `pytest`.

```shell
pip install pytest   # using pip
pipx install pytest  # using pipx
uv add --dev pytest  # using uv
```


## Known Issues

- The current implementation tallies the number of states searched during recursive assembly index calculation.
If the number of states searched exceeds the (very large) limit of a `usize`, the code panics.
This is unlikely to occur when various kernelization, memoization, and bounding strategies are enabled to prune the search space, but is theoretically always possible given a large enough molecule and sufficiently long search time.
See [#49](https://github.com/DaymudeLab/assembly-theory/issues/49) for details.
