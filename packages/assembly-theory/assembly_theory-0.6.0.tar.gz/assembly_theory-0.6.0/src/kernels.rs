//! Kernelize match-compatibility graphs to improve top-down search efficiency.
//!
//! The problem of computing the minimum assembly index of a molecule can be
//! reduced to finding the maximum weight clique in a compatibility graph over
//! matches (i.e., pairs of edge-disjoint isomorphic subgraphs). Strucutral
//! properties of this graph can be used to determine match pairs (i.e., nodes)
//! that *definitely will* or *definitely won't* be used in an optimal
//! solution. We call the process of identifying these nodes *kernelization*.
//! Uses the strategies of neighborhood removal, isolated vertex removal, and
//! domination as described in Section 5.2 of [Lamm et al.
//! (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1137/1.9781611975499.12). (Note that they solve
//! the equivalent problem of weighted independent set.)
