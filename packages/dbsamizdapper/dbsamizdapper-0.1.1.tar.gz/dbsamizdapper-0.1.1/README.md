# Dbsamizdapper

The "blissfully naive PostgreSQL database object manager"
This is based on the original `dbsamizdat` code from https://git.sr.ht/~nullenenenen/DBSamizdat/ a version of which was previously hosted at `https://github.com/catalpainternational/dbsamizdat`

Full disclosure: That one (https://git.sr.ht/~nullenenenen/DBSamizdat/ which is also on pypi) is definitely less likely to have bugs, it was written by a better coder than I am, the original author is "nullenenenen <nullenenenen@gavagai.eu>"

## Quick Start

**For detailed usage examples, see [USAGE.md](USAGE.md)**

### Basic Example

1. Create a module with your database views:

```python
# myapp/views.py
from dbsamizdat import SamizdatView

class UserStats(SamizdatView):
    sql_template = """
        ${preamble}
        SELECT COUNT(*) as total_users FROM users
        ${postamble}
    """
```

2. Sync to your database:

```bash
# Using CLI (modules are automatically imported)
python -m dbsamizdat.runner sync postgresql:///mydb myapp.views

# Or using library API
python -c "from dbsamizdat import sync; sync('postgresql:///mydb', samizdatmodules=['myapp.views'])"
```

### Key Points

- **Module Import**: The CLI automatically imports modules you specify - no need to manually import them first
- **Database Connection**: Use `DBURL` environment variable or pass connection string directly
- **Python 3.12+**: Requires Python 3.12 or later
- **PostgreSQL Only**: Works exclusively with PostgreSQL databases
- **Dollar-Quoting**: `$$` does not work in SQL functions - use tags like `$BODY$` instead (see [USAGE.md](USAGE.md#dollar-quoting-in-functions-))

## Installation

### For Users
```bash
pip install dbsamizdapper
```

### For Development

This project uses [UV](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for fast dependency management.

**Install UV:**
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
# or
pip install uv
```

**Setup development environment:**
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repo-url>
cd dbsamizdapper

# Install dependencies (includes dev tools)
uv sync --group dev --group testing

# Optional: Install Django type stubs for Django integration development
uv sync --group dev --group testing --extra django
```

**Available dependency groups (development):**
- `dev` - Development tools (black, isort, flake8, mypy, etc.)
- `testing` - Test framework and PostgreSQL testing with psycopg2-binary

**Available extras (optional runtime features):**
- `django` - Django 4.2 and type stubs for Django integration
- `psycopg3` - Use psycopg3 instead of psycopg2

## New features

This fork is based on a rewrite which I did to better understand the internals of `dbsamizdat` as we use it in a few different projects. The changes include:

 - Python 3.12+
 - Type hints throughout the codebase
 - Changed from `ABC` to `Protocol` type for inheritance
 - UV for fast dependency management
 - **Table Management** (new in 0.0.6)
   - `SamizdatTable` - Manage database tables as Samizdat objects
   - UNLOGGED table support for performance-critical use cases
 - **Django QuerySet integration** (0.0.5)
   - `SamizdatQuerySet` - Create views from Django QuerySets
   - `SamizdatMaterializedQuerySet` - Materialized views from QuerySets
   - `SamizdatModel` - Unmanaged Django models as views
   - `SamizdatMaterializedModel` - Materialized views from models
 - Compat with both `psycopg` and `psycopg3`
 - Opinionated code formatting
   - black + isort
   - replaced `lambda`s
 - some simple `pytest` functions

and probably many more undocumented changes

### Table Management Example

```python
from dbsamizdat import SamizdatTable

class MyTable(SamizdatTable):
    """Manage a table as a Samizdat object"""
    sql_template = """
    CREATE TABLE ${samizdatname} (
        id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
        name TEXT NOT NULL,
        created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
    )
    """

class MyCacheTable(SamizdatTable):
    """UNLOGGED table for better performance"""
    unlogged = True
    sql_template = """
    CREATE TABLE ${samizdatname} (
        key TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
        value JSONB,
        expires_at TIMESTAMP
    )
    """
```

### Django QuerySet Example

```python
from dbsamizdat import SamizdatMaterializedQuerySet
from myapp.models import MyModel

class MyComplexView(SamizdatMaterializedQuerySet):
    """Create a materialized view from a complex QuerySet"""
    queryset = MyModel.objects.select_related('related').filter(
        active=True
    ).annotate(
        custom_field=F('field1') + F('field2')
    )

    # Optionally specify tables that trigger refresh
    refresh_triggers = [("myapp", "mymodel")]
```


## Development Commands

**Run tests:**
```bash
uv run pytest
```

**Linting and formatting:**
```bash
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff format .
uv run mypy dbsamizdat
```

**Pre-commit hooks:**
This project uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) for automated code quality checks. Install it using [uv](https://adamj.eu/tech/2025/05/07/pre-commit-install-uv/):

```bash
# Install pre-commit with uv (recommended method)
uv tool install pre-commit --with pre-commit-uv

# Install Git hooks (runs automatically on commit)
pre-commit install

# Run on all files manually
pre-commit run --all-files

# Run on staged files only
pre-commit run

# Run a specific hook
pre-commit run ruff --all-files

# Update pre-commit hooks to latest versions
pre-commit autoupdate

# Upgrade pre-commit itself
uv tool upgrade pre-commit
```

**Note:** Pre-commit hooks will automatically run when you commit. To skip hooks (not recommended), use `git commit --no-verify`.

**Build package:**
```bash
uv build
```

## Running Tests

Spin up a podman or docker container

`podman run -p 5435:5432 -e POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD=trust docker.io/library/postgres`
`docker run -p 5435:5432 -e POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD=trust postgres:latest`

The db url for this container would be:

"postgresql:///postgres@localhost:5435/postgres"

Make this the environment variable `DB_URL`, or add it to the `.env` file
