## Features

- **Object Detection**: Inference for object detection models
- **Image Classification**: Inference for image classification models  
- **Image Segmentation**: Inference for image segmentation models
- **Preprocessing**: Built-in image preprocessing utilities
- **Easy to Use**: Simple API for quick model inference

## Installation

```bash
pip install model-mp-core
```
