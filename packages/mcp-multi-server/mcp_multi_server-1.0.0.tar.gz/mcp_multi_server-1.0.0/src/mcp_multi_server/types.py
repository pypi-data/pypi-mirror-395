    This class stores all the capabilities (tools, resources, templates, prompts)

    track what each server can do and to aggregate capabilities across all servers.

    Attributes:
        name: The unique identifier for the server.
        tools: List of tools provided by the server, if any.
        resources: List of resources provided by the server, if any.
        resource_templates: List of resource templates provided by the server, if any.
        prompts: List of prompts provided by the server, if any.

    Note:
        All capability fields (tools, resources, etc.) are optional because:
        - A server may not implement all capability types
        - Capability discovery may fail for some types while succeeding for others
        - Empty capability lists are represented as None rather than empty lists
