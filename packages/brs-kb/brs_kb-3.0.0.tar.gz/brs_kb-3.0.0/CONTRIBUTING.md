## How to Contribute

There are many ways to contribute to BRS-KB:

1. **Add new XSS vectors** - Share your knowledge about new attack techniques
2. **Update existing contexts** - Keep information current with latest bypasses
3. **Improve documentation** - Help make the knowledge base more accessible
4. **Report issues** - Found outdated info or errors? Let us know
5. **Share examples** - Add real-world attack examples and POCs
6. **Improve code** - Enhance the loader, API, or tooling

## Adding New XSS Contexts

### Step 1: Create a New Module

Create a new Python file in `brs_kb/contexts/` directory:

```bash
touch brs_kb/contexts/your_new_context.py
```

### Step 2: Follow the Template

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

}
```

### Step 3: Validate Your Module

Run validation to ensure your module meets the schema:

```bash
pytest tests/test_knowledge_base.py -k "test_schema_validation"
```

### Step 4: Test Integration

```python
from brs_kb import get_vulnerability_details

details = get_vulnerability_details('your_new_context')
print(details['title'])
```

## Updating Existing Contexts

When updating existing context modules:

1. **Add new attack vectors** - Share new techniques you've discovered
2. **Update bypass methods** - Keep defenses current
3. **Improve clarity** - Make explanations more understandable
4. **Add examples** - Real-world examples are valuable
5. **Update metadata** - Keep CVSS scores and CWE mappings accurate

**Important**: Always increment the version in comments and update the date.

## Code Style Guidelines

### Language
- **All content must be in English** - This is a global project
- Use clear, professional language
- Avoid slang or regional expressions

### Python Code
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use meaningful variable names
- Keep lines under 100 characters
- Add comments for complex logic

### File Headers
Every file must include:

```python

```

### Content Guidelines
- Be accurate and precise
- Provide working, tested payloads
- Include references to sources
- Cite CVEs when applicable
- Add framework versions when relevant

## Testing

Before submitting your contribution:

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest tests/ -v

# Run specific tests
pytest tests/test_knowledge_base.py -v

# Check code style
black --check brs_kb/
pylint brs_kb/

# Type checking
mypy brs_kb/
```

If tests don't exist yet, that's okay - the project is growing!
