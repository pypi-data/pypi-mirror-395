           TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
        
           1. Definitions.
        
              "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
              and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
        
              "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
              the copyright owner that is granting the License.
        
              "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
              other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
              control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
              "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
              direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
              otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
              outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
        
              "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
              exercising permissions granted by this License.
        
              "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
              including but not limited to software source code, documentation
              source, and configuration files.

              transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
              not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
              and conversions to other media types.
        
              "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
              Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
              copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
              (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
        
              "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
              submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise

              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

# ScriptChat

A terminal-based, scriptable chat client for interacting with local LLMs (via Ollama)
and remote LLMs via OpenAI-compatible providers (OpenAI, DeepSeek...) and Anthropic Claude.

## Features

- Full-screen terminal UI with conversation history, status bar, and input pane
- Multiple pre-configured models with easy switching
- Persistent, file-based conversations (save, load, and branch)
- Multi-line message support
- Send file contents into the chat
- Token usage tracking
- Temperature adjustment
- System prompts

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- Optional: [Ollama](https://ollama.com) installed and accessible in your PATH

## Installation

### Via pipx (recommended)

```bash
pipx install scriptchat
```

This installs the `scriptchat` command (and the shorter `sc` alias) globally.

### Via pip

```bash
pip install scriptchat
```

### From source

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/scriptchat/scriptchat.git
   cd scriptchat
   ```

2. Install in development mode:
   ```bash
   pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```

### Configuration

After installation, create your configuration file:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.scriptchat
# Copy the example config (if installing from source)
cp config.toml.example ~/.scriptchat/config.toml
# Or create a new one based on the example in the repository
```

Edit `~/.scriptchat/config.toml` to configure your models and preferences. See `config.toml.example` for a complete example.

Key configuration options:

- `default_provider`: Provider id to use on startup (see `[[providers]]`)
- `default_model`: Model to use on startup (for the default provider)
- `default_temperature`: Temperature for new conversations (0.0-2.0)
- `system_prompt`: System prompt for all conversations (override per conversation with `/prompt`)
- `conversations_dir`: Where to store conversations (set in `[general]`)
- `exports_dir`: Where to write exports (defaults to current working directory if not set)
- `enable_streaming`: Enable token streaming (default: false)
- `[[providers]]`: List of model providers. Each has an `id`, `type` (`ollama`, `openai-compatible`, or `anthropic`), `api_url`, optional `api_key`, `models` (comma-separated or list of tables), optional `default_model`, and optional `streaming`/`headers`. A model entry can include `contexts` (for Ollama), `reasoning_levels` (for `/reason` on reasoning-capable models), and `reasoning_default` to pick the level applied when you select that model.

**API Keys:** If `api_key` is not set in config, ScriptChat will look for `{PROVIDER_ID}_API_KEY` environment variable (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`).

Example providers:
```toml
[general]
default_provider = "ollama"
default_model = "llama3"

[[providers]]
id = "ollama"
type = "ollama"
api_url = "http://localhost:11434/api"
models = "llama3,phi3"

[[providers]]
id = "openai"
type = "openai-compatible"
api_url = "https://api.openai.com"
api_key = "sk-..."
models = [
  { name = "gpt-5-mini", reasoning_levels = ["minimal", "medium", "high"], reasoning_default = "medium" },
  { name = "gpt-5.1-mini", reasoning_levels = ["none", "low", "medium", "high"], reasoning_default = "none" }
]

[[providers]]
id = "deepseek"
type = "openai-compatible"
api_url = "https://api.deepseek.com"
api_key = "sk-..."
models = "deepseek-chat,deepseek-coder"

[[providers]]
id = "anthropic"
type = "anthropic"
api_url = "https://api.anthropic.com"
api_key = "sk-ant-..."
models = [
  { name = "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", reasoning_levels = ["low", "medium", "high", "max"] },
  { name = "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022" }
]
```

## Usage

Run ScriptChat:

```bash
scriptchat
# or use the shorter alias:
sc
```

In batch mode you can allow assertions to log but keep running using `--continue-on-error` (exit code will still be 1 if any assertion fails):

```bash
scriptchat --run tests/demo.txt --continue-on-error
```

You can also pipe a script via stdin (no `--run` needed):

```bash
cat tests/demo.txt | scriptchat
```

Check version:

```bash
scriptchat --version
```

### Commands

All commands start with `/`:

**Conversation**
- `/new` - Start a new conversation
- `/save` - Save the current conversation
- `/load [index|name]` - Load a saved conversation by index or name
- `/branch` - Create a branch (copy) of the current conversation
- `/rename` - Rename a saved conversation (renames its directory)
- `/chats` - List saved conversations
- `/clear [index]` - Clear and delete the current conversation, or delete a saved conversation by index (requires confirmation)

**Export/Import**
- `/export [format]` - Export the current conversation (formats: `md`, `json`, `html`; prompts if omitted). `json` includes full metadata; `md`/`html` are minimal, human-friendly transcripts.
- `/export-all [format]` - Export all saved conversations in the given format.
- `/import <path>` - Import a conversation exported as `md` or `json` into the conversations folder

**Model & Settings**
- `/model` - Switch to a different model (for the current provider)
- `/temp` - Change the temperature setting
- `/reason [level]` - Show or set the reasoning level (`low`, `medium`, `high`, `max`). For Anthropic Claude, these map to thinking budgets (4K, 16K, 32K, 55K tokens). `/reason` alone lists available levels.
- `/thinking [tokens]` - Set exact thinking budget in tokens for Anthropic Claude (1024-128000). Use `/thinking off` to disable. Overrides `/reason` presets.
- `/timeout <seconds|0|off>` - Set the request timeout in seconds, or disable with `0` or `off`
- `/stream [on|off]` - Toggle or set streaming of assistant responses
- `/prompt [text|clear]` - Set or clear the system prompt for this conversation (prompts if omitted)

**Files**
- `/file [--force] <path>` - Register a file for use as `@path` in messages (content is expanded when sending, message stores `@path`). Use `--force` for large files above `file_confirm_threshold_bytes`.
- `/files [--long]` - List registered files (with sizes and hashes when using `--long`)

**Tags**
- `/tag key=value` - Apply metadata tags to the conversation (shown in `/chats` and `/load`)
- `/untag <key>` - Remove a metadata tag from the conversation
- `/tags` - List tags on the current conversation

**Messaging**
- `/send <message>` - Queue a message (sends immediately if the model is idle)
- `/history [n|all]` - Show recent user messages in current conversation (persists if saved/loaded; default: last 10)
- `/note <text>` - Add a note to the conversation (saved and visible, but not sent to model)
- `/undo [n]` - Remove the last user/assistant exchange(s) from the conversation. Without n, it removes 1.
- `/retry` - Drop the last assistant message and resend the previous user message

**Testing & Debug**
- `/assert <pattern>` - Assert the last assistant response contains the given text/regex (exits with error in batch mode). `/assert` checks only the last assistant message; it's case-insensitive and treats the pattern as a regex (falls back to substring if the regex is invalid).
- `/assert-not <pattern>` - Assert the last assistant response does NOT contain the text/regex (same matching rules as `/assert`).
- `/echo <text>` - Print a message to the console without sending to the model
- `/log-level <debug|info|warn|error|critical>` - Adjust runtime logging verbosity without restarting
- `/profile [--full]` - Show current provider/model/temp, tokens, streaming/timeout, and registered files. Use `--full` to show complete system prompt

**Scripting**
- `/run <path>` - Execute a script file (one command/message per line; lines starting with `#` are comments)
- `/sleep <seconds>` - Pause execution for the specified duration (scripts/batch mode only)
- `/set <name>=<value>` - Define a script variable for use with `${name}` syntax
- `/vars` - List all defined variables

**System**
- `/help [command|keyword]` - Show help for all commands, a specific command, or search by keyword.
- `/keys` - Show keyboard shortcuts
- `/exit` - Exit ScriptChat

### Multi-line Messages

To enter a multi-line message:

1. Type `"""` and press Enter
2. Enter your message across multiple lines
3. Type `"""` on a new line to send

This syntax also works in script files (`/run` or `--run`):

```bash
"""
Analyze this code for:
- Security issues
- Performance problems
"""
```

### Script Variables

Use `/set` to define variables that can be referenced with `${name}` syntax:

```bash
/set model=llama3
/model ${model}
/set greeting=Hello, how are you?
${greeting}
```

Variables are expanded in both commands and messages. Variable names must start with a letter or underscore and contain only letters, numbers, and underscores.

**Environment variable fallback:** If a variable isn't defined via `/set`, ScriptChat checks environment variables. This enables parameterized scripts:

```bash
# Run with different configurations
LANGUAGE=Python TOPIC="error handling" scriptchat --run test.sc
LANGUAGE=Rust TOPIC="memory safety" scriptchat --run test.sc
```

Script variables (`/set`) take precedence over environment variables. Unknown variables are left unexpanded.

**Security:** Sensitive environment variables matching patterns like `*_KEY`, `*_SECRET`, `*_TOKEN`, `*_PASSWORD` are blocked from expansion by default. Configure in `config.toml`:

```toml
[general]
# Disable env var expansion entirely
env_expand_from_environment = false

# Or override the default blocklist with your own patterns
env_var_blocklist = ["MY_PRIVATE_*", "INTERNAL_*"]

# Use empty list to allow all env vars (no blocklist)
env_var_blocklist = []
```

### Keyboard Shortcuts

**Navigation**
- `Ctrl+Up` - Focus conversation pane for scrolling

### File References

`/file [--force] <path>` registers a file for use in messages. Include `@path` in any user message to inline the file contents when sending (the stored message keeps `@path` for readability). Examples:

- Register: `/file docs/plan.md`
- Send with inline file: `Summarize @docs/plan.md and list action items.` (you can also use `@{docs/plan.md}` or `@plan.md` if unique)
- If an `@path` isn’t registered, the send will error and nothing is sent.

You can register multiple files and mix references in one message. `/profile` lists full paths of registered files.

### Conversation Storage

Conversations are stored in `~/.scriptchat/conversations/` (or your configured directory) with the following structure:

- Each conversation is a directory: `YYYYMMDDHHMM_modelname_savename/`
- Messages are stored as individual files: `0001_user.txt`, `0002_llm.txt`, etc.
- Metadata is stored in `meta.json`

You can manually edit message files or delete them as needed.

## Example Workflow

1. Start ScriptChat: `python -m scriptchat`
2. Chat with the default model
3. Save your conversation: `/save` then enter a name
4. Switch models: `/model` then select a model
5. Continue chatting with the new model
6. Rename or branch to organize: `/rename new-name` or `/branch`
7. Load a previous conversation: `/load`
8. Exit when done: `/exit` or Ctrl+C

See the [`examples/`](examples/) folder for runnable scripts demonstrating interactive workflows and batch testing.

## Status Bar

The status bar shows:
- Provider and model (e.g., `ollama/llama3.2`) with optional reasoning level in parentheses
- Token usage (input/output), with optional context usage percentage
- Conversation ID (or `<unsaved>` for new conversations)
- Thinking indicator when the model is processing

Example: `ollama/llama3.2 (high) | 1234 in / 567 out | 202511180945_llama32_my-chat`

## Troubleshooting

**"Ollama executable not found"**: Ensure Ollama is installed and in your PATH.

**"Configuration file not found"**: Create `~/.scriptchat/config.toml` from the example.

**"An Ollama instance is already running"**: ScriptChat detects if Ollama is already running on the configured port. You can:
- Use the existing instance (recommended for most cases)
- Start a new ScriptChat-managed instance on an alternative port
- Exit and stop the existing instance first

**Connection errors**: If using an external Ollama instance, check that it's still running. If ScriptChat manages the instance, check that Ollama is installed and the port is available.

**Model not found**: Make sure the model is pulled in Ollama (`ollama pull modelname`) and configured in `config.toml`.
