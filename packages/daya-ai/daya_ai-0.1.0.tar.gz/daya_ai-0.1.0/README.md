AI Helpers
===========

Small helper library wrapping OpenAI API calls for simple use in apps.

Example usage:

```python
from ai_helpers import get_response

print(get_response("Tell me a joke"))
```

Notes:
- Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in your environment or `.env` before using functions.
- This package is intentionally small and designed to be imported by web apps.
