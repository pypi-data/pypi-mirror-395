This module allows to generate and render some pie charts for your Odoo
projects.

It consists of two pie charts on the project form view:

- number of installed modules
- number of lines of code

Both measures are split based on some criteria (configurable), by
default:

- Odoo CE
- Odoo Enterprise
- OCA
- Community (not OCA)
- Specific code
- Misc. (everything not part of other criteria above)

Each criteria having a rendering color used on the charts.
