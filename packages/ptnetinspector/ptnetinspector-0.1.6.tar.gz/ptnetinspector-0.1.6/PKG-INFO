<span style="color:orange;">ptnetinspector</span> is a versatile tool designed to 
perform comprehensive scans over IPv6 networks, with support for dual-stack environments 
to ensure compatibility with both IPv4 and IPv6 infrastructures. This tool provides detailed 
insights into the network's topology, identifying critical information such as IP, MAC, 
multicast groups, router information and the role of discovered nodes.

Beyond basic network reconnaissance, this Penterep tool is equipped with advanced vulnerability 
detection capabilities, scanning nodes for known security weaknesses and misconfigurations. 
This enables network administrators to proactively identify and mitigate risks.


## Install Requirements  
 
Before proceeding, it is recommended to update your system to ensure compatibility:  
```bash  
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y  
```  

This application requires **Python3**. Make sure it is installed, along with the `python3-venv` package, for managing virtual environments:  
```bash  
sudo apt install python3 python3-venv -y  
```  

### Steps to Install Dependencies, sudo should be used  

#### 1. **Create a Virtual Environment (if not already created)**  
You can create a virtual environment with any name you prefer. Replace `<env_name>` with your chosen name in the following command:  
```bash
python3 -m venv <env_name>
```
For example, if you want to name your virtual environment `myenv`, use:  
```bash
python3 -m venv myenv
```

#### 2. **Activate the Virtual Environment**  
After creating the virtual environment, activate it by specifying its name. Replace `<env_name>` with the name you used during creation:  
```bash
source <env_name>/bin/activate
```
For instance, if the name is `myenv`, use:  
```bash
source myenv/bin/activate
```

#### 3. **Install the package**

After installing the dependencies, install the package itself so you can run the `ptnetinspector` command.
It's recommended to install in editable/development mode if you plan to modify the code:

```bash
# inside your activated virtual environment
pip install -e .
# or for a regular install:
pip install .
```

Installing with `-e` (editable) lets you edit the source in-place and run the installed command without reinstalling.

### Important Notes  
For future use, you don’t need to reinstall the dependencies. Simply activate the created virtual environment before running the application:  
```bash  
source myenv/bin/activate 
```  
By following these steps, you ensure a clean and consistent installation process while avoiding potential errors due to system-level dependency conflicts or pip management.  


## Usage
This tool has 4 primary modes (802.1x, passive, active, aggressive). Some of these modes can be combined to perform a more complex task. The tool must be run under the <span style="color:red;">**root**</span> user in Linux (```sudo```). The meaning of every mode and parameters are explained below.

```
ptnetinspector -t 802.1x/a/a+/p -i eth0 -j -less
```

### General Options

The following options are applicable to all scan modes:

| Option  | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `-t`    | Type of scan (**mandatory**, can choose more than one): <br> - `802.1x`: Network test for 802.1x protocol <br> - `a`: Active mode for network scanning <br> - `a+`: Aggressive mode for network scanning <br> - `p`: Passive mode for network scanning |
| `-i`    | Interface (**mandatory**) |
| `-j`    | Output in JSON format. Displays only JSON output unless used with other options. Includes errors if present. |
| `-n`    | Prevents deletion of `.csv` files in the `tmp` folder. |
| `-more` | Displays full details of the network scan. When used with `-j`, outputs detailed and JSON data. Default: Basic details are shown. |
| `-less` | Displays minimum details of the network scan. When used with `-j`, outputs minimal and JSON data. Default: Basic details are shown. |
| `-h`    | Displays help message and exits. |

### Specific Options for Passive Scanning

| Option  | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `-d`    | Duration of the passive scan in seconds (floating-point allowed). Default: 30 seconds. |

### Specific Options for Aggressive Scanning

| Option     | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `-da+`     | Duration of the aggressive scan in seconds (floating-point allowed). Default: 30 seconds. |
| `-prefix`  | Prefix advertised by the scanner. Default: `fe80::/64`. |
| `-smac`    | Scanner's MAC address. Default: Taken from the interface specified by `-i`. |
| `-sip`     | Scanner's IPv6 address. Default: Taken from the interface specified by `-i`. Prefers a link-local address. |
| `-rpref`   | Router preference flag (`Reserved`, `Low`, `Medium`, `High`). Default: `High`. |
| `-period`  | Rate of RA packet sending (1 packet per `-period` seconds, floating-point allowed). Default: `Aggressive duration / 10`. |
| `-chl`     | Current hop limit in RA messages. Default: 0. |
| `-mtu`     | MTU advertised on the link. Excluded if not specified. |
| `-dns`     | IPv6 address(es) of DNS server(s). Multiple addresses can be space-separated. Excluded if not specified. |
| `-nofwd`   | Prevents the scanner from forwarding packets (MiTM). Forwarding is allowed by default. |

## Examples

### 802.1x Mode
Send an EAPOL-Start and wait for responses.
```
ptnetinspector -t 802.1x -i eth0 -j
```

### Passive Mode
Deactivate outgoing traffic, disable IP, and sniff incoming packets.
```
ptnetinspector -t p -i eth0 -less
```

### Active Mode
Test vulnerabilities with packets such as MLD, ICMPv6, LLMNR, and mDNS.
```
ptnetinspector -t a -i eth0 -more
```

### Aggressive Mode
Perform active scans while emulating a fake router. Configure additional parameters.
```
ptnetinspector -t a+ -i eth0 -j -da+ 35 -prefix 2001:1::/64 -smac 00:01:02:03:04:05 -sip fe80::1 -period 5
```

### Combination of Modes
Combine 802.1x and passive scans for a complex scenario. Specify passive scan duration.
```
ptnetinspector -t 802.1x p -i eth0 -j -d 10
```
