# KavachNet

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/kavachnet.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/kavachnet)

**KavachNet** is a lightweight, real-time IP intelligence tool that instantly flags VPNs, proxies, and cloud-hosted IPs. It recognizes addresses from major providers like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud to help secure your application against anonymized traffic. Developed and maintained by Rishabh KRW.

## Features

*   **Web Interface**: A built-in Streamlit dashboard to check IPs visually.
*   **Python API**: Easy-to-use functions to integrate into your own Python applications.
*   **Auto-Updates**: Fetches the latest IP ranges from public sources (e.g., Azure Service Tags).
*   **Caching**: Caches IP lists locally to improve performance and reduce network calls.

## Installation

Install the package via pip:

```bash
pip install kavachnet
```

## Usage

### 1. Web Interface (CLI)

To launch the interactive web dashboard:

```bash
kavachnet-web
```

### 2. Python API

You can use `kavachnet` directly in your Python scripts to check IP addresses.

```python
from kavachnet import is_vpn_ip, refresh_cache

# Check a single IP
ip_to_check = "8.8.8.8"
result = is_vpn_ip(ip_to_check)

if result:
    print(f"{ip_to_check} is a VPN/Data Center IP!")
else:
    print(f"{ip_to_check} appears to be a residential or unknown IP.")

# Force update the local cache of VPN IP ranges
refresh_cache()
```

## How It Works

KavachNet aggregates public IP ranges from major cloud hosting services and VPN services. When you check an IP, it verifies if the IP falls within these known subnets. Built and maintained by Rishabh KRW.
