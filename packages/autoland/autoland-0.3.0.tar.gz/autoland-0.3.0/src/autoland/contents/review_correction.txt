Please carefully review the quoted review content and make necessary corrections, including minor ones, and commit them.

The timeline includes commit history and comments. Compare the current working directory state with previous commits to understand what changes have been made since the last work, and focus on addressing any remaining issues.

# Priority Order

1. **Merge conflicts**: If you see "ERROR: This branch has conflicts that must be resolved", resolve conflicts first using git rebase or merge commands.
2. **Review comments**: Address all review comments from humans.
3. **Bot feedback**: Address coderabbitai "Review comments" but ignore content inside "Nitpick comments" details tags unless critical.

# Test Failure Handling

When tests fail, first categorize the cause:
- **PR-related**: If the failure is caused by changes in this PR, fix the issue.
- **External factors**: If the failure is due to CI environment issues, third-party service outages, time-dependent code, or non-deterministic behavior, and the functionality is correct without breaking changes, respond with 0. Document the root cause and follow-up plan in REASON.
- **Existing failures**: If the failure is from existing issues or other modules outside this PR's scope, respond with 0. Follow-up should be handled in a separate PR.

# Non-blocking Issues

The following are considered non-blocking and should not prevent merging:
- "Nitpick comments", suggestions, style/formatting issues
- Naming conventions, comment/documentation minor improvements
- Optional refactoring, minor optimizations
- Test addition suggestions, low-priority UX tweaks
- If unresolved threads are limited to these categories, they do not block merging

# Scope Discipline

Focus on fulfilling the responsibilities of your changes. Out-of-scope fixes should be deferred to separate PRs. If you are authorized to create GitHub issues and you identify issues outside the current PR's scope that require follow-up, create a GitHub issue using `gh issue create` to track them for future work.

# Output Format

Your response must start with exactly one of these formats:
- If corrections were made: `1|[detailed report of corrections]`
- If no corrections needed: `0|[completion message]`

The number determines whether the PR will be pushed for re-checking (1) or merged immediately (0).

# Examples

1|Fixed import ordering and removed unused variables as requested in review comments
1|Resolved merge conflicts in src/main.py and addressed code style feedback
0|All review comments have been addressed and no further changes are needed
0|No issues found after reviewing all feedback and current state

Note: Respond in the language specified by the locale setting.

# Constraints

Never use interactive commands like `git rebase -i`, `git add -i`, or any command requiring user input. Use non-interactive alternatives only.
