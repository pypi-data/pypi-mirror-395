## What to Do Now (3 Simple Steps)

### Step 1️⃣: Register Trusted Publisher on TestPyPI (5 minutes) ⚠️ CRITICAL

**This step is REQUIRED for the workflow to work.**

1. **Open TestPyPI settings:** https://test.pypi.org/manage/project/chroma-ingestion/settings/publishing/
   - Must be logged in as project owner

2. **Click "Add a new pending publisher"** and fill in:
   ```
   Publisher name:    GitHub
   Repository owner:  ollieb89
   Repository name:   chroma-tool
   Workflow name:     publish-test.yml
   Environment name:  (leave empty)
   ```

3. **Click "Save pending publisher"**

4. **GitHub will send approval link** - Click and approve on TestPyPI

5. **Verify** - TestPyPI should show your publisher with ✅ Active status

**Why:** PyPI needs to verify that GitHub Actions running your workflow is legitimate before allowing uploads.

See detailed guide: **[TRUSTED_PUBLISHING_SETUP.md](TRUSTED_PUBLISHING_SETUP.md)**

### Step 2️⃣: Register Trusted Publisher on Production PyPI (5 minutes) ⚠️ CRITICAL

1. **Open PyPI settings:** https://pypi.org/manage/project/chroma-ingestion/settings/publishing/
   - Must be logged in as project owner

2. **Click "Add a new pending publisher"** and fill in:
   ```
   Publisher name:    GitHub
   Repository owner:  ollieb89
   Repository name:   chroma-tool
   Workflow name:     publish.yml
   Environment name:  (leave empty)
   ```

3. **Click "Save pending publisher"**

4. **GitHub will send approval link** - Click and approve on PyPI

5. **Verify** - PyPI should show your publisher with ✅ Active status

**Why:** You need separate publishers for TestPyPI and Production PyPI. They're different services with different repositories.

---

### Step 3️⃣: Test Pre-Release Workflow (30 minutes)

Test everything works before production release:

```bash
cd /home/ob/Development/Tools/chroma

# Create pre-release tag
git tag -a v0.2.0rc1 -m "Release candidate for testing"
git push origin v0.2.0rc1
```

Now watch GitHub Actions:
1. Go to your repo → Actions tab
2. Look for workflow: "Publish to TestPyPI"
3. Should complete in 2-3 minutes ✅

**What's different:** No API token authentication errors! The workflow uses Trusted Publishing automatically.

Once it completes, verify installation:
```bash
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ chroma-ingestion==0.2.0rc1
chroma-ingest --help  # Should work!
```

If everything works, continue to Step 3. If something fails:
- Check GitHub Actions logs (should show no authentication errors)
- See TRUSTED_PUBLISHING_SETUP.md for troubleshooting
- See docs/guides/troubleshooting.md for common issues

---

### Step 4️⃣: Production Release (2 minutes)

Once testing passes, release to production:

```bash
cd /home/ob/Development/Tools/chroma

# Create production release tag
git tag -a v0.2.0 -m "Release v0.2.0 - Production Ready"
git push origin v0.2.0
```

**That's it!** GitHub Actions automatically:
1. ✅ Builds the distribution
2. ✅ Publishes to PyPI
3. ✅ Creates GitHub Release
4. ✅ Verifies installation
5. ✅ Deploys documentation

Verify on PyPI:
```bash
pip install chroma-ingestion
chroma-ingest --help  # Should work!
```

Check it on PyPI:
- https://pypi.org/project/chroma-ingestion/
