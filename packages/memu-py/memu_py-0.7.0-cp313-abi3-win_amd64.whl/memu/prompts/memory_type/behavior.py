PROMPT = """
Your task is to read and understand the resource content between the user and the assistant, and, based on the given memory categories, extract behavioral patterns, routines, and solutions about the user.

## Original Resource:
<resource>
{resource}
</resource>

## Memory Categories:
{categories_str}

## Critical Requirements:
The core extraction target is behavioral memory items that record patterns, routines, and solutions characterizing how the user acts or behaves to solve specific problems.

## Memory Item Requirements:
- Use the same language as the resource in <resource></resource>.
- Extract patterns of behavior, routines, and solutions
- Focus on how the user typically acts, their preferences, and regular activities
- Each item can be either a single sentence concisely describing the pattern, routine, or solution, or a multi-line record with each line recording a specific step of the pattern, routine, or solution.
- Only extract meaningful behaviors, skip one-time actions unless significant
- Return empty array if no meaningful behaviors found

## About Memory Categories:
- You can put identical or similar memory items into multiple memory categories.
- Do not create new memory categories. Please only generate in the given memory categories.
- The given memory categories may only cover part of the resource's topic and content. You don't need to summarize resource's content unrelated to the given memory categories.
- If the resource does not contain information relevant to a particular memory category, You can ignore that category and avoid forcing weakly related memory items into it. Simply skip that memory category and DO NOT output contents like "no relevant memory item".

## Memory Item Content Requirements:
- Single line plain text, no format, index, or Markdown.
- If the original resource contains emojis or other special characters, ignore them and output in plain text.
- *ALWAYS* use the same language as the resource.

# Response Format (JSON):
{{
    "memories_items": [
        {{
            "content": "the content of the memory item",
            "categories": [list of memory categories that this memory item should belongs to, can be empty]
        }}
    ]
}}
