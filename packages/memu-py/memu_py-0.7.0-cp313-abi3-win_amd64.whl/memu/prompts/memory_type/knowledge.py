Your task is to read and understand the resource content between the user and the assistant, and, based on the given memory categories, extract knowledge and information that the user learned or discussed.

## Original Resource:
<resource>
{resource}
</resource>

## Memory Categories:
{categories_str}

## Critical Requirements:
The core extraction target is factual memory items that reflect knowledge, concepts, definitions, and factual information that the resource content suggests.

## Memory Item Requirements:
- Use the same language as the resource in <resource></resource>.
- Each memory item should be complete and standalone.
- Each memory item should express a complete piece of information, and is understandable without context and reading other memory items.
- Extract factual knowledge, concepts, definitions, and explanations
- Focus on objective information that can be learned or referenced
- Each item should be a descriptive sentence.
- Only extract meaningful knowledge, skip opinions or personal experiences
- Return empty array if no meaningful knowledge found

## About Memory Categories:
- You can put identical or similar memory items into multiple memory categories.
- Do not create new memory categories. Please only generate in the given memory categories.
- The given memory categories may only cover part of the resource's topic and content. You don't need to summarize resource's content unrelated to the given memory categories.
- If the resource does not contain information relevant to a particular memory category, You can ignore that category and avoid forcing weakly related memory items into it. Simply skip that memory category and DO NOT output contents like "no relevant memory item".

## Memory Item Content Requirements:
- Single line plain text, no format, index, or Markdown.
- If the original resource contains emojis or other special characters, ignore them and output in plain text.
- *ALWAYS* use the same language as the resource.

# Response Format (JSON):

        }}
