## Examples
See examples of how fastquadtree can be used in the [runnables](https://elan456.github.io/fastquadtree/runnables/) section.


## Install
```bash
pip install fastquadtree
```

```python
from fastquadtree import QuadTree  # Point handling

## API

[See the full API](https://elan456.github.io/fastquadtree/api/quadtree/)

### `QuadTree(bounds, capacity, max_depth=None, track_objects=False, dtype="f32")`

* `bounds` — tuple `(min_x, min_y, max_x, max_y)` defines the 2D area covered by the quadtree
* `capacity` — max number of points kept in a leaf before splitting
* `max_depth` — optional depth cap. If omitted, the tree can keep splitting as needed
* `track_objects` — if `True`, the wrapper maintains an id → object map for convenience.
* `dtype` — data type for coordinates, e.g., `"f32"`, `"f64"`, `"i32"`, `"i64"`

### Key Methods

- `insert(xy, *, obj=None) -> int`

- `query(rect, *, as_items=False) -> list`

- `nearest_neighbor(xy, *, as_item=False) -> (id, x, y) | Item | None`

- `delete(id, xy) -> bool`

There are more methods and object tracking versions in the [docs](https://elan456.github.io/fastquadtree/api/quadtree/).

### Geometric conventions

* Rectangles are `(min_x, min_y, max_x, max_y)`.
* Containment rule is closed on the min edge and open on the max edge
  `(x >= min_x and x < max_x and y >= min_y and y < max_y)`.
  This only matters for points exactly on edges.

## Performance tips

* Choose `capacity` so that leaves keep a small batch of points. Typical values are 8 to 64.
* If your data is very skewed, set a `max_depth` to prevent long chains.
* For fastest local runs, use `maturin develop --release`.
* The wrapper maintains an object map only if the quadtree was constructed with `track_objects=True`. If you don't need it, leave it off for best performance.
* Refer to the [Native vs Shim Benchmark](https://elan456.github.io/fastquadtree/benchmark/#native-vs-shim-benchmark) for overhead details.

### Pygame Ball Pit Demo

![Ballpit_Demo_Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Elan456/fastquadtree/main/assets/ballpit.png)

A simple demo of moving objects with collision detection using **fastquadtree**. 
You can toggle between quadtree mode and brute-force mode to see the performance difference.

See the [runnables guide](https://elan456.github.io/fastquadtree/runnables/) for setup instructions.

## FAQ

**Can I delete items from the quadtree?**
Yes! Use `delete(id, xy)` to remove specific items. You must provide both the ID and exact location for precise deletion. This handles cases where multiple items exist at the same location. If you're using `track_objects=True`, you can also use `delete_by_object(obj)` for convenient object-based deletion with O(1) lookup. The tree automatically merges nodes when item counts drop below capacity.

**Can I store rectangles or circles?**
Yes, you can store rectangles using the `RectQuadTree` class. Circles can be approximated with bounding boxes. See the [RectQuadTree docs](https://elan456.github.io/fastquadtree/api/rect_quadtree/) for details.

**Do I need NumPy installed?**  
No, NumPy is a fully optional dependency. If you do have NumPy installed, you can use methods such as `query_np` and the NumPy array variant of `insert_many` for better performance. The Rust core is able to handle NumPy arrays faster than Python lists, so there's a lot of time savings in utilizing the NumPy functions. See the [Native vs Shim benchmark](https://elan456.github.io/fastquadtree/benchmark/#native-vs-shim) for details on how returing NumPy arrays can speed up queries.

**Does fastquadtree support multiprocessing?**  
Yes, fastquadtree objects can be serialized to bytes using the `to_bytes()` method and deserialized back using `from_bytes()`. This allows you to share quadtree data across processes and even cache prebuilt trees to disk. See the [interactive v2 demo](https://github.com/Elan456/fastquadtree/blob/main/interactive/interactive_v2.py) for an example of saving and loading a quadtree.
