## Install (PyPI)

Install the latest released version from PyPI:

```sh
# User environment (recommended)
python -m pip install --user git-commit-message

# Or system/virtualenv as appropriate
python -m pip install git-commit-message

# Or with pipx for isolated CLI installs
pipx install git-commit-message

# Upgrade to the newest version
python -m pip install --upgrade git-commit-message
```

Quick check:

```sh
git-commit-message --help
```

Set your API key (POSIX sh):

```sh
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
```

Note (fish): In fish, set it as follows.

```fish
set -x OPENAI_API_KEY "sk-..."
```

## Install (editable)

```sh
python -m pip install -e .
```

## Usage

- Print commit message only:

```sh
git add -A
git-commit-message "optional extra context about the change"
```

- Force single-line subject only:

```sh
git-commit-message --one-line "optional context"
```

- Limit subject length (default 72):

```sh
git-commit-message --one-line --max-length 50 "optional context"
```

- Commit immediately with editor:

```sh
git-commit-message --commit --edit "refactor parser for speed"
```

```sh
# American English
git-commit-message --language en-US "optional context"

# Korean
git-commit-message --language ko-KR

# Japanese
