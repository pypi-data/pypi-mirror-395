# Bilevel-Solver

This repository contains a bilevel solver packaged for Python. The solver is aimed at variational inequalities defined
over the solution set of a monotone inclusion problem. The problem setting and the employed algorithm are described
in [[1]](#1).

## Installation

The package is available through pip, and may be installed via:

```bash
pip install Bilevel-Solver
```

If running the package locally, you can install it using:

```bash
pip install .
```

## Examples

Examples may in found in the [/examples](/examples) directory of the repository. These examples additionally constitute
the plots generated in the paper [[1]](#1).
