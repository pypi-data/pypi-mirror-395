# Chern

Chern is a data analysis management toolkit designed for high energy physics research. It provides a structured environment for organizing projects, tasks, algorithms, and data, enabling reproducible and collaborative scientific workflows.

## Key Features and Benefits

Chern provides several advantages for scientific data analysis:

- **Structured Organization:** Clear separation of data, algorithms, and tasks
- **Dependency Tracking:** Automatic monitoring of relationships between objects
- **Version Control:** Impressions system for tracking object states over time
- **Reproducibility:** Complete capture of workflow and parameters
- **Adaptability:** Easy modification and re-execution of analysis components
- **Collaboration:** Project sharing and management capabilities

## Features

- **Project Management:** Create, organize, and switch between multiple analysis projects.
- **Task & Algorithm Handling:** Define tasks and algorithms with configuration files and documentation.
- **Data Organization:** Manage raw and processed data with clear directory structures.
- **Interactive Shell:** Launch an IPython shell for interactive exploration and command execution.
- **Extensible:** Easily add new commands, algorithms, and data types.
