# Simplification Rules

This document describes all the simplification rules implemented in the SymbAnaFis symbolic computation library.

## Overview

The simplification system applies rules in a bottom-up manner through the expression tree, using multiple passes until no further simplifications are possible. Rules are organized into modules by mathematical domain and applied in priority order (higher priority first).

### Priority Strategy: Expand → Cancel → Compact

Rules follow an **expand → cancel → compact** ordering strategy:

| Priority Range | Phase | Purpose |
|----------------|-------|--------|
| **85-95** | Expansion | Distribute, expand powers, flatten nested structures |
| **70-84** | Identity/Cancellation | x^0→1, x^1→x, x/x→1, x^a/x^b→x^(a-b) |
| **40-69** | Compression/Consolidation | Combine terms, factor, compact a^n/b^n→(a/b)^n |
| **1-39** | Canonicalization | Sort terms, normalize display form |

This ordering ensures expressions are first expanded to expose cancellation opportunities, then simplified via identities and cancellations, and finally compacted into canonical form.

## Rule Categories

Rules are grouped by category and listed in priority order within each category.

#### Identity/Cancellation Phase (70-84)
- **sqrt_power** (priority: 85) - Rule for sqrt(x^n) = x^(n/2). Returns abs(x) when sqrt(x^(even)) simplifies to x^1

- **normalize_roots** (priority: 50) - Rule that applies the monolithic root normalization

## Domain Safety

Some simplification rules make assumptions about the domain of validity for the expressions they transform. These rules are marked with **[alters domain]** in the rule descriptions above.

When domain-safe mode is enabled, rules that alter domains are skipped to ensure that simplifications remain valid across the entire complex plane or real line, depending on the context. This prevents incorrect simplifications that might introduce new singularities or restrict the domain inappropriately.

### Enabling Domain-Safe Mode

Domain-safe mode can be enabled in several ways:

1. **Environment variable**: Set `SYMB_ANAFIS_DOMAIN_SAFETY=true`
2. **Programmatically**: Use `Simplifier::new().with_domain_safe(true)`

## Debugging and Tracing

### Rule Application Tracing

To debug simplification and see which rules are being applied, set the `SYMB_TRACE` environment variable:

```bash
SYMB_TRACE=1 cargo run --example your_example
```

This will print each rule application to stderr, showing:
- The rule name being applied
- The original expression
- The simplified result

This is useful for diagnosing rule interaction issues and understanding the simplification process.

## Fixed Variables Support

The simplification system supports "fixed variables" - symbols that should be treated as user-specified constants rather than mathematical constants like `e` (Euler's number).

When a variable is marked as "fixed":
- Rules like `e_pow_ln` and `e_pow_mul_ln` will NOT apply special handling for `e`
- The symbol `e` will be treated as a regular variable/constant

### Usage

```rust
// In diff() or simplify() functions, pass fixed variables:
diff("e*x".to_string(), "x".to_string(), Some(&["e".to_string()]), None);
// Here "e" is treated as a constant coefficient, not Euler's number
```

## Rule Count Summary

| Category | Count |
|----------|-------|
| Numeric | 13 |

| **Total** | **123** |

## Implementation Details

- All rules are applied recursively bottom-up through the expression tree
- The system uses cycle detection to prevent infinite loops
- Rules are applied in multiple passes until convergence
- Numeric precision uses ε = 1e-10 for floating-point comparisons
- The system preserves exact symbolic forms when possible
- **Rule priority ordering**: Higher priority numbers run first (e.g., priority 95 runs before 40). Key priority tiers:
  - 85-95: Expansion rules (flatten, distribute, expand powers)
  - 70-84: Identity/Cancellation rules (x^0=1, x/x=1, power arithmetic)
  - 40-69: Compression/Consolidation rules (combine terms, factor, compact)
  - 1-39: Canonicalization rules (sort terms, normalize display)
- **Expand → Cancel → Compact strategy**: Rules are ordered so expressions are first expanded to expose simplification opportunities, then simplified via identities and cancellations, and finally compacted into canonical form. This ordering reduces the need for complex conditional checks in individual rules.
- **Factoring vs Distribution balance**: `CommonTermFactoringRule` (priority 40) runs before distribution rules to ensure factored forms are preserved. Distribution is handled by `MulDivCombinationRule` (priority 85) which combines multiplication with division without conflicting with factoring rules.
- **Canonical form handling**: Many rules recognize both original forms (e.g., `a - b`) and canonical forms after algebraic simplification (e.g., `a + (-1)*b`)
- **Recursive simplification**: Subexpressions are simplified before applying rules to the current level
- **Expression normalization**: Multiplication terms are sorted and normalized for consistent term combination
- **Negative term recognition**: Rules handle expressions with explicit negative coefficients (e.g., `a + (-b)`)
- **Identity preservation**: Operations like `1 * x` and `x * 1` are reduced to `x` for cleaner output

### Display Correctness

The display module (`display.rs`) includes critical fixes to ensure mathematical correctness:

- **Power base parenthesization**: When displaying `x^n`, if `x` is a `Mul`, `Div`, `Add`, or `Sub` expression, it is parenthesized to avoid operator precedence ambiguity. For example:
  - `(C * R)^2` displays as `(C * R)^2`, not `C * R^2` (which would mean `C * (R^2)`)
  - `(a / b)^n` displays as `(a / b)^n`, not `a / b^n` (which would mean `a / (b^n)`)
- **Division denominator parenthesization**: Denominators containing `Mul`, `Div`, `Add`, or `Sub` are parenthesized:
  - `a / (b * c)` displays correctly, not `a / b * c` (which would mean `(a / b) * c`)
  
These fixes ensure that the displayed form matches the internal expression tree structure and can be parsed back correctly without ambiguity.
