# TESS centroid_vetting

Attempt to make a centroid vetting function graphically similar to the one used in the DV reports of TCE's produced by the TESS Science Processing Pipeline.<br/>
This centroid presentation allows to identify the source of the dips in a lightcurve, discarding eventual false positives and identifying possible sources of contamination.

## Installation
Since version 1.2.0, a package is available at PyPi.<br>
So, the simplest way of installing TESS-Centroid_Vetting is using pip:

`pip install tesscentroidvetting`

## Dependencies:
- numpy
- matplotlib
- astropy
- astroquery
- scipy
- lightkurve
- ipywidgets - only needed if interact=True in show_transit_margins()

## Usage
See the notebooks in Examples directory for usage.
