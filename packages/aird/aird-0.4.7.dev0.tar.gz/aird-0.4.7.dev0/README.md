}
```

## 🔌 API Usage

Aird provides a comprehensive REST API for all operations:

### File Operations
```bash
# List files in a directory
GET /api/files/path/to/directory

# Upload a file
POST /upload
Content-Type: multipart/form-data

# Download a file
GET /files/path/to/file?download=1

# Edit a file
POST /edit/path/to/file
Content-Type: application/json
{"content": "new file content"}

# Delete a file
POST /delete
Content-Type: application/json
{"path": "path/to/file"}
```

### Search Operations
```bash
# Search for text patterns
GET /search?q=search+term&path=/directory

# WebSocket search (real-time)
WebSocket: /search/ws
```

### Share Management
```bash
# Create a share
POST /share/create
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "paths": ["/path/to/file1", "/path/to/file2"],
  "share_type": "static",
  "expiry_date": "2024-12-31T23:59:59"
}

# List active shares
GET /share/list

# Update a share
POST /share/update
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "share_id": "share-id",
  "share_type": "dynamic",
  "allow_list": ["*.txt", "*.log"]
}
```

### WebSocket Streaming
```javascript
// Connect to file streaming
const ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8080/stream/path/to/logfile.log');

ws.onmessage = function(event) {
    const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
    console.log('New line:', data.line);
};
```

### P2P File Transfer
```javascript
// Connect to P2P signaling server
const ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8080/p2p/signal');

// Create a room and share link
ws.send(JSON.stringify({
    type: 'create_room',
    allow_anonymous: true,  // Optional: allow anonymous access
    file_info: {
        name: 'document.pdf',
        size: 1024000,
        type: 'application/pdf'
    }
}));

// Join a room using share link
ws.send(JSON.stringify({
    type: 'join_room',
    room_id: 'share-code-here'
}));

// WebRTC signaling (offer, answer, ICE candidates)
ws.onmessage = function(event) {
    const message = JSON.parse(event.data);
    // Handle WebRTC signaling messages
    if (message.type === 'offer') {
        // Process WebRTC offer
    }
};
```

## 🛠️ Building Custom Applications

Aird's API-first design makes it perfect for building custom applications:

### Example: Custom File Manager
```python
import requests

class AirdClient:
    def __init__(self, base_url, token):
        self.base_url = base_url
        self.headers = {'Authorization': f'Bearer {token}'}
    
    def list_files(self, path):
        response = requests.get(f'{self.base_url}/api/files/{path}', headers=self.headers)
        return response.json()
    
    def search_files(self, query, path='/'):
        response = requests.get(f'{self.base_url}/search', 
                              params={'q': query, 'path': path}, 
                              headers=self.headers)
        return response.json()
    
    def create_share(self, paths, share_type='static'):
        data = {'paths': paths, 'share_type': share_type}
        response = requests.post(f'{self.base_url}/share/create', 
                               json=data, headers=self.headers)
        return response.json()

# Usage
client = AirdClient('http://localhost:8080', 'your-token')
files = client.list_files('/documents')
results = client.search_files('error', '/logs')
```

### Example: Log Monitoring Dashboard
```javascript
// Real-time log monitoring
const logStream = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8080/stream/var/log/app.log');

logStream.onmessage = function(event) {
    const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
    addLogEntry(data.line, data.timestamp);
};

function addLogEntry(line, timestamp) {
    const logContainer = document.getElementById('logs');
    const entry = document.createElement('div');
    entry.className = 'log-entry';
    entry.innerHTML = `<span class="timestamp">${timestamp}</span> ${line}`;
    logContainer.insertBefore(entry, logContainer.firstChild);
}
```
