"""Send alerts through HTTP webhooks to external endpoints.

This module implements HTTP-based alert delivery for sending notifications
to webhook endpoints or external HTTP services. It enables configuration-driven
alerting without requiring code changes to support different webhook targets,
custom headers, or retry strategies.

    """Send alert messages to HTTP endpoints or webhooks.

    Delivers alerts to HTTP endpoints with configurable methods, headers, and
    retry behavior. Supports custom HTTP headers for authentication and content
    negotiation, making it suitable for integration with external systems, APIs,
    and webhook platforms.

    Inherits HTTP request handling from HttpBase, providing automatic retry logic
    with configurable delays and timeout behavior. The channel type is automatically
    set to "http" for use in alert channel discrimination.

    Attributes:
        channel_type: Literal "http" discriminator for channel type resolution.
        id_: Unique identifier for this alert channel.
        description: Human-readable description of the channel's purpose.
        enabled: Whether this channel is active for sending alerts.
        url: HTTP endpoint URL where alerts are sent.
        method: HTTP method (POST, PUT, etc.) for the alert request.
        headers: Optional dictionary of HTTP headers (Authorization, Content-Type, etc.).
        timeout: Request timeout in seconds.
        retry: Retry configuration with max attempts and delay between retries.

    Example:
        >>> from samara.alert.channels.http import HttpChannel
        >>> config = {
        ...     "id": "webhook_alerts",

    Note:
        The alert payload is automatically formatted as JSON with "title" and
        "message" fields. Ensure the receiving endpoint can handle this format.

        with exponential backoff delays between attempts.
