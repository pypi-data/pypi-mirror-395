"""Alert channel base classes and interfaces.

This module provides the abstract base for implementing alert channels
in configuration-driven pipelines. It establishes a common interface
that enables different notification systems (email, HTTP webhooks, files)
to work consistently within the alert framework.

    """Define abstract interface for alert channel implementations.

    Concrete channel implementations must inherit from this base class
    and implement the _alert method to handle channel-specific message
    delivery. Each subclass should define a channel_type field with a
    specific Literal value to ensure type safety and proper type discrimination
    in configuration-based routing.

    Attributes:
        id_: Unique identifier for the alert channel used in configuration
            and logs. Must be non-empty.
        description: Human-readable description of the alert channel purpose
            or configuration.
        enabled: Boolean flag controlling whether this channel is active.
            Disabled channels do not send alerts.

    Example:
        **Configuration in JSON:**
        ```
        {
            "channels": [
                {
                    "type": "email",
                    "id": "support_team",
                    "description": "Alert the support team",
                    "enabled": true,
                    "recipients": ["support@company.com"],
                    "smtpServer": "smtp.company.com",
                    "smtpPort": 587
                }
            ]
        }
        ```

        **Configuration in YAML:**
        ```
        channels:
          - type: email
            id: support_team
            description: Alert the support team
            enabled: true
            recipients:
              - support@company.com
            smtpServer: smtp.company.com
            smtpPort: 587
        ```

    Note:
        The `id_` field uses an alias to map to the configuration key `id`
        for cleaner configuration files while avoiding Python's built-in
        identifier naming.
