"""HTTP action for making HTTP requests in ETL pipeline event hooks.

This module implements the HTTP action that enables ETL pipelines to communicate
with external HTTP endpoints when pipeline events occur (onStart, onSuccess,
onFailure, onFinally). It supports configurable HTTP methods, custom headers,
payloads, timeouts, and retry logic for robust external integrations.

    """Send HTTP requests to external endpoints when pipeline events occur.

    This action enables communication with external HTTP services (webhooks,
    APIs, etc.) as part of pipeline event hooks. It supports custom headers,
    request payloads, configurable timeouts, and automatic retry logic for
    reliable external integrations in the configuration-driven pipeline.

    Attributes:
        id_: Unique identifier for this action (inherited from ActionBase).
        description: Human-readable description of this action's purpose
            (inherited from ActionBase).
        enabled: Whether this action executes when the event is triggered
            (inherited from ActionBase).
        url: HTTP endpoint URL to send requests to (inherited from HttpBase).
        method: HTTP method to use: GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, etc.
            (inherited from HttpBase).
        headers: Optional HTTP headers to include in requests
            (inherited from HttpBase).
        timeout: Request timeout in seconds, range 1-30 (inherited from HttpBase).
        retry: Retry configuration with max_attempts and delay_in_seconds
            (inherited from HttpBase).
        action_type: Always "http" for HTTP actions.
        payload: Optional JSON payload to send in the request body.

    Example:
        Execute when a pipeline succeeds. Include the parent hook key:

        - Payloads are sent as JSON regardless of method type
        - Retry logic applies exponential backoff between attempts
        - Failed actions log warnings but do not fail the pipeline execution
