class Hooks(BaseModel):
    """Manage actions triggered at job lifecycle events.

    Execute custom actions at key pipeline stages within a job lifecycle.
    Each hook field accepts a list of configurable actions that run when
    their corresponding event occurs, enabling flexible alerting and
    post-processing workflows.

    Attributes:
        onStart: Actions to execute when the job begins processing.
        onError: Actions to execute if the job encounters an error.
        onSuccess: Actions to execute when the job completes successfully.
        onFinally: Actions to execute when the job ends, regardless of outcome.

    Example:
        **Configuration in JSON:**
        ```
        {
            "onStart": [
                {
                    "type": "http",
                    "url": "https://example.com/webhook",
                    "method": "POST"
                },
                {
                    "type": "email",
                    "recipients": ["admin@example.com"],
                    "subject": "Job started"
                }
            ],
            "onSuccess": [
                {
                    "type": "email",
                    "recipients": ["admin@example.com"],
                    "subject": "Job completed successfully"
                }
            ],
            "onError": [
                {
                    "type": "file",
                    "path": "logs/errors.log"
                }
            ],
            "onFinally": []
        }
        ```

        **Configuration in YAML:**
        ```
        onStart:
          - type: http
            url: https://example.com/webhook
            method: POST
          - type: email
            recipients:
              - admin@example.com
            subject: Job started
        onSuccess:
          - type: email
            recipients:
              - admin@example.com
            subject: Job completed successfully
        onError:
          - type: file
            path: logs/errors.log
        onFinally: []
        ```

    Note:
        Actions execute sequentially in the order defined. If any action fails,
        execution continues with the remaining actions. Use the onFinally hook
        for cleanup operations that must run regardless of job outcome.
