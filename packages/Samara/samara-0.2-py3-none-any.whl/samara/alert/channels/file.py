"""File alert channel - Write alerts to file destinations.

This module provides file-based alert delivery enabling users to persist
alerts to log files or other file destinations. It supports configurable
file paths and handles file system operations with appropriate error reporting."""

    """Write alert messages to file destinations.

    This channel implementation persists alerts to configured file paths,
    creating files if they do not exist. Alerts are appended line-by-line
    with title and body combined in a readable format.

    Attributes:
        channel_type: Always "file" for file channels.
        file_path: Path to the destination file where alerts are written.

    Example:
        >>> from pathlib import Path
        >>> config = {
        ...     "channel": {
        ...         "type": "file",
        ...         "filePath": "/var/log/alerts.log"
        ...     }
        ... }
        >>> channel = FileChannel(**config["channel"])
        >>> channel._alert("Pipeline Failed", "Job 'daily_sync' failed at 14:30")

        **Configuration in JSON:**
        ```
        {
            "alerts": [
                {
                    "channel": {
                        "type": "file",

                    "triggers": [...]
                }
            ]
        }
        ```

        **Configuration in YAML:**
        ```
        alerts:
          - channel:
              type: file
              filePath: /var/log/pipeline_alerts.log
            triggers: [...]
        ```

    Note:
        The parent directory of the specified file path must exist and
        be writable. File write failures are logged as errors and re-raised.
