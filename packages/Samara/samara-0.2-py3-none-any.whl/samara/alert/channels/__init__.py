"""Alert channels - Configurable notification destinations for pipeline events.

This package provides pluggable alert channels that enable notifications
through multiple communication platforms. Each channel implements a unified
interface supporting configuration-driven setup and consistent behavior
across different delivery mechanisms (email, HTTP webhooks, file logging).

Channel implementations handle transport-specific concerns while exposing
a common configuration schema, allowing pipeline authors to swap notification
targets without modifying pipeline definitions.
