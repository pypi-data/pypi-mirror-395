"""Alert module - Configure and execute notifications based on pipeline events.

This module provides the alerting system for configuration-driven pipelines,
enabling users to define alert rules and notification channels in their
pipeline configuration. It focuses on rule-based triggers and multi-channel
delivery, allowing alerts to be sent via email, HTTP webhooks, or files
when pipeline events (success, failure, start, end) occur.
