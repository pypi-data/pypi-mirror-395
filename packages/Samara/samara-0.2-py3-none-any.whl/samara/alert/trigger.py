"""Alert triggers - Configuration-driven rules for channel routing.

This module provides the trigger rules system that routes alerts to appropriate
notification channels based on flexible rule conditions. Triggers enable
sophisticated alert logic by evaluating exception properties and environment
context to determine which channels should receive notifications."""

class AlertTrigger(BaseModel):
    """Route alerts to channels based on flexible rule conditions.

    Represents a single trigger rule that determines when and to which channels
    alerts should be routed during pipeline execution. Triggers evaluate rules
    against exception properties and environment context to enable sophisticated
    alert logic without code changes.

    Attributes:
        id_: Unique identifier for the trigger rule.
        enabled: Whether this rule is currently active.
        description: Human-readable description of the trigger purpose.
        channel_ids: List of channel identifiers that receive alerts matching this rule.
        template: Template configuration for formatting alert messages.
        rules: List of rules that must all evaluate to True for the trigger to fire (AND logic).

    Example:
        >>> from samara.alert.trigger import AlertTrigger
        >>> trigger = AlertTrigger(
        ...     id="prod-critical-alerts",
        ...     enabled=True,
        ...     description="Alert production errors",
        ...     channel_ids=["ops-email"],
        ...     template=AlertTemplate(...),
        ...     rules=[...]
        ... )

    Note:
        All rules must evaluate to True (AND logic) for the trigger to fire.
        If no rules are configured, the trigger fires by default. Triggers
        enable routing without modifying pipeline code.
