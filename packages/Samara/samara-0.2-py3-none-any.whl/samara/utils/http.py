    Defines how HTTP requests should handle transient failures through configurable
    retry attempts and delays. This configuration model aligns with Samara's
    declarative approach, allowing retry strategies to be specified in pipeline
    configuration files without modifying code.

    Attributes:
        max_attempts: Maximum number of retry attempts (0-3) for failed requests.
        delay_in_seconds: Delay between retry attempts in seconds (1-30).

    Provides shared HTTP request handling for alert notifications and event-triggered

    endpoints, methods, headers, and retry behavior to be defined in configuration
    files. Used by alert channels and actions to communicate with external HTTP
    endpoints, webhooks, and services.

    Attributes:
        url: HTTP endpoint URL for sending requests.
        method: HTTP method to use (GET, POST, PUT, etc.), minimum 1 character.
        headers: Dictionary of HTTP headers to include in requests (default: empty).
