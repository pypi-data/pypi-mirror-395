create_asset_spec:
  description: >
    Create specification documents for required 3D assets.

    Asset categories:
    1. CREATURES: Otter, Wolf, Fox, Bear, Rabbit, Fish, etc.
    2. ENVIRONMENT: Trees, rocks, grass clumps, water plants
    3. PROPS: Nests, dens, food items, collectibles

    For each asset, specify:
    - Visual description (reference images conceptually)
    - Size and scale relative to otter (0.6m long)
    - Polygon budget (target < 5k tris per creature)
    - Required animations
    - LOD requirements
    - Texture resolution (512x512 or 1024x1024)

    Reference species designs from creature design docs.

    for each asset type, organized by priority.

generate_prompts:
  description: >
    Generate optimized Meshy prompts for each asset.

    Prompt structure for creatures:
    "A realistic [species], quadruped, [pose], detailed fur/scales texture,
    game asset style, low poly optimized, neutral pose for animation"

    Prompt structure for environment:
    "[Object type], stylized nature game asset, hand-painted texture style,
    optimized geometry, [biome] environment"

    Generate prompts for priority assets:
    1. River Otter (player character)
    2. Wolf (primary predator)
    3. Rabbit (prey)
    4. Fish (food source)
    5. Trees (forest biome)

    Include retexture prompts for color variants.
  expected_output: >
    Prompt Library Document with:
    - Primary prompts for each asset
    - Retexture variation prompts
    - Negative prompt suggestions
    - Expected quality settings
  agent: prompt_engineer

define_qa_criteria:
  description: >
    Define quality assessment criteria for generated assets.

    Quality dimensions:
    1. Visual quality (texture clarity, color accuracy)
    2. Technical quality (topology, UV mapping)
    3. Style consistency (fits game aesthetic)
    4. Animation readiness (proper rigging points)
    5. Performance (polygon count, texture size)

    Create a scoring rubric (1-10) for each dimension.
    Define minimum passing scores.
    Document common issues and how to identify them.
  expected_output: >
    Asset QA Rubric with:
    - Scoring criteria for each dimension
    - Pass/fail thresholds
    - Common issue checklist
    - Regeneration triggers (when to reject and redo)
