    Design the core gameplay loop for the game.

    The player is an otter. The core loop should:
    1. Feel natural for an otter's lifestyle
    2. Support both casual and dedicated play sessions
    3. Work well on mobile with touch controls
    4. Create meaningful moment-to-moment decisions

    Consider loops like:
    - Explore → Gather → Craft → Upgrade
    - Hunt → Eat → Grow → Expand Territory
    - Day cycle: Forage → Avoid predators → Rest

    Define the primary, secondary, and meta loops.

    A Core Loop Design Document containing:
    - Primary loop (moment-to-moment, 30 seconds)
    - Secondary loop (session goals, 10-30 minutes)
    - Meta loop (long-term progression, hours/days)
    - How loops interconnect
    - Mobile session length considerations

  description: >
    Design the combat system for an otter protagonist.

    Otter combat capabilities:
    - Bite attack (primary)
    - Claw swipe (secondary)
    - Dodge/roll (defensive)
    - Dive underwater (escape)
    - Use environment (rocks, water)

    Combat philosophy:
    - Avoid when possible, engage when necessary
    - Size matters: can't fight a bear directly
    - Stealth and positioning are key
    - Water is the otter's advantage

    Design for mobile touch controls.

    A Combat Design Document containing:
    - Attack types and damage values
    - Defense and dodge mechanics
    - Enemy threat levels and engagement strategies
    - Control scheme for mobile
    - Combat feel guidelines (timing, feedback)

    Design progression and economy systems.

    Resources to manage:
    - Food (health/stamina regeneration)
    - Materials (crafting, nest building)
    - Territory (safe zones, respawn points)
    - Reputation (with other species?)

    Progression elements:
    - Otter growth/stats
    - Abilities unlocked
    - Territory expansion
    - Collection/bestiary

    No microtransactions - this is a premium game.

    A Progression Design Document containing:
    - Resource types and acquisition methods
    - Progression curves and milestones
    - Unlock conditions for abilities/areas
    - Long-term goals and completion metrics
    - Anti-grind measures
