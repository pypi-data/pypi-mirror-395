design_species_roster:
  description: >
    Design the complete species roster for the game.

    Categories:
    1. PLAYER: River Otter (Lutra canadensis)
    2. PREDATORS: Wolf, Fox, Bear, Badger, Eagle, Pike
    3. PREY: Rabbit, Deer, Mouse, Frog, Fish, Crayfish
    4. NEUTRAL: Turtle, Beaver, Heron, Songbirds

    For each species, define:
    - Scientific name and common name
    - Size, mass, and physical description
    - Habitat preferences (which biomes)
    - Diet and hunting/foraging behavior
    - Threat level to the player
    - Unique characteristics or abilities

    Reference the DFU creature mappings in shared/backend/dfu_analysis/
    for fantasy-to-natural-world conversion patterns.
  expected_output: >
    A Species Roster Document with detailed profiles for each creature,
    formatted to match the SpeciesContract TypeScript interface.
    Include all required fields: id, archetype, displayName, scientificName,
    size, mass, maxSpeed, turnRate, etc.
  agent: creature_designer

define_behaviors:
  description: >
    Define AI behavior patterns for all creatures using Yuka.js concepts.

    Behavior archetypes:
    1. PREDATOR: Hunt → Stalk → Attack → Eat → Rest
    2. PREY: Graze → Alert → Flee → Hide → Return
    3. OMNIVORE: Forage → Assess → Engage/Flee
    4. NEUTRAL: Patrol → React → Return

    For each species, define:
    - State machine with transitions
    - Detection ranges and reaction times
    - Group behavior (pack hunting, herding)
    - Territory and patrol patterns
    - Time-of-day variations

    The behaviors should integrate with Yuka.js steering behaviors
    and state machine patterns.
  expected_output: >
    A Behavior Design Document with:
    - State machine diagrams (text representation)
    - Transition triggers and conditions
    - Numerical parameters (detection range, flee speed, etc.)
    - Yuka.js implementation notes
  agent: behavior_specialist

balance_stats:
  description: >
    Balance all creature stats for engaging gameplay.

    The otter (player) baseline:
    - Health: 100
    - Damage: 10-15
    - Speed: 8 m/s (swim), 5 m/s (land)
    - Detection avoidance: Medium

    Balance considerations:
    1. Combat should be avoidable through stealth/speed
    2. Direct combat should be risky but possible
    3. Pack predators should require strategy
    4. Prey should provide meaningful rewards
    5. Difficulty should scale by biome

    Create stat curves that feel fair across all player skill levels.
  expected_output: >
    A Balance Spreadsheet (in markdown table format) showing:
    - All creature stats relative to player baseline
    - Combat outcome predictions (1v1, group scenarios)
    - Difficulty ratings by biome
    - Recommended player level/gear for each encounter type
  agent: stats_balancer
