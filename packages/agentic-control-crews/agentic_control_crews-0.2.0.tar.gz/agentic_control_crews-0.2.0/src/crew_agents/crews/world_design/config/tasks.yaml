define_world_structure:
  description: >
    Define the high-level structure of the game world.

    Requirements:
    - World is centered around a marsh/wetland ecosystem
    - Player is an otter navigating this world
    - Mobile-first design (small chunks, not overwhelming)
    - 7 distinct biomes must connect logically

    Deliverables:
    1. World map concept (text description of layout)
    2. Biome adjacency rules (which biomes connect)
    3. Day/night cycle effects on gameplay
    4. Weather system overview
    5. World size and scale recommendations

    Consider the Daggerfall Unity data mappings in shared/backend/dfu_analysis/
    for inspiration on creature and terrain variety.
  expected_output: >
    A comprehensive World Structure Document in markdown format containing:
    - World overview and theme
    - Biome distribution map (ASCII or description)
    - Environmental rules
    - Scale and pacing guidelines
    - Technical constraints for mobile (draw distance, chunk size)
  agent: world_architect

design_biomes:
  description: >
    Design detailed specifications for each of the 7 biomes.

    Biomes to design:
    1. Marsh (home biome - safest)
    2. Forest (moderate difficulty)
    3. Desert (harsh, resource-scarce)
    4. Tundra (cold, stamina drain)
    5. Savanna (open, predator-heavy)
    6. Mountain (vertical, stamina-intensive)
    7. Scrubland (transitional, mixed hazards)

    For each biome, define:
    - Visual theme and color palette
    - Environmental hazards
    - Available resources
    - Native creatures
    - Gameplay modifiers (speed, stamina, visibility)
    - Unique mechanics or features

    Reference the BiomeContract in shared/contracts/BiomeContract.ts
  expected_output: >
    A Biome Design Document with detailed specs for all 7 biomes,
    formatted to match the BiomeContract TypeScript interface.
    Include color hex codes, numerical modifiers, and resource lists.

create_ecosystem_rules:
  description: >
    Define the ecological relationships that make the world feel alive.

    Design:
    1. Food chains for each biome
    2. Predator-prey relationships
    3. Resource regeneration rates
    4. Population dynamics
    5. Cross-biome migrations
    6. Seasonal variations

    The ecosystem should create emergent gameplay where player actions
    have consequences (overhunting affects predator populations, etc.)

    Reference the SpeciesContract in shared/contracts/SpeciesContract.ts
    and the DFU creature mappings in shared/backend/dfu_analysis/
  expected_output: >
    An Ecosystem Rules Document containing:
    - Food web diagrams (text representation)
    - Population balance formulas
    - Resource respawn timers
    - Migration patterns
    - Cause-and-effect relationships
    All designed to create engaging emergent gameplay.
