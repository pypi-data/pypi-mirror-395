# Reusable Agent Archetypes
#
# These are base templates that packages can extend in their own agents.yaml.
# Use the 'extends' field to inherit from an archetype.
#
# Example usage in packages/mypackage/.crewai/crews/builder/agents.yaml:
#   my_engineer:
#     extends: senior_engineer
#     variables:
#       language: Python
#     backstory: |
#       {base}
#       Additional context specific to my package...
