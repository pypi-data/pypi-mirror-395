Dynamic Model Architecture - True Decentralization

This module implements a model that grows and shrinks with the network:
- NO fixed phases or model sizes
- Model size = what the network can collectively hold
- Each node contributes based on its available memory
- More memory = more layers = more NEURO rewards

Key Concepts:
1. LAYER POOL: The network maintains a pool of layers
2. DYNAMIC ASSIGNMENT: Nodes claim layers based on their capacity
3. ORGANIC GROWTH: As more nodes join, model can have more layers
4. GRACEFUL DEGRADATION: If nodes leave, layers are redistributed

Example:
  Day 1: 10 nodes with 4GB each = 40GB total = ~10B params possible
  Day 30: 100 nodes with avg 8GB = 800GB total = ~200B params possible
  
  The model AUTOMATICALLY grows as capacity grows.
  No voting, no phases, no central coordination.
