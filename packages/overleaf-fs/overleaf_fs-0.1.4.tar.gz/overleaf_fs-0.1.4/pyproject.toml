# === Release instructions ===
# 1. Update version number below (X.Y.Z) and commit the change.
#    Push the main branch so the tagged commit is on GitHub:
#      git push origin main
#    The tag in step 2 must match this version.
# 2. Create the tag and push it.
#   git tag vX.Y.Z
#   git push origin vX.Y.Z
# 3. Create a GitHub Release.
#    Go to the Releases page in the GitHub repository
#    Click “Draft a new release”
#    Select the tag (e.g. vX.Y.Z)
#    Give the release a title and (optionally) release notes
#    Click Publish release
# 4. GitHub Actions will publish to PyPI.
