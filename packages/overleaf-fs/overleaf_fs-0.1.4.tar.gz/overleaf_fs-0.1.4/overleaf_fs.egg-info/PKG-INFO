OverleafFS: GUI-based project browser for Overleaf LaTeX Projects
=================================================================

**OverleafFS** (Overleaf File System) is a Python package for managing Overleaf (https://www.overleaf.com/) LaTeX projects in a file-browser GUI.

**Key features:**

* Intuitive, drag-and-drop interface.
* Persistent caching of Overleaf credentials to minimize logins.
* Ability to share folder structure across multiple computers using Dropbox or other cloud-based storage.
