# ANDClust
 
This package implementsthe ANDClust (Adaptive Neighborhood Distance-Based Clustering Algorithm to Cluster Varying Density and/or Neck-Typed Datasets) algorithm.

## Installation

```bash
pip install andclust
```

## Usage

```bash
from andclust import ANDClust
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
from sklearn.metrics.cluster import adjusted_rand_score

data=load_iris()
X,y=data['data'],data['target']

scaler = MinMaxScaler()
scaler.fit(X)
X = scaler.transform(X)

model = ANDClust(N=2,k=14,eps=0.113) # If you want to change kernel and band_with use model = ANDClust(N=2,k=14,eps=0.113,kernel='gaussian',b_width=0.025) default values for optional parameter krnl='gaussian', b_width=0.5 options for kernel are{“gaussian”, “tophat”, “epanechnikov”, “exponential”, “linear”, “cosine”}
labels = model.fit_predict(X)

ARI=adjusted_rand_score(labels,y)
print("ARI=", ARI)

```

## Features

	- Detects arbitrary-shaped clusters due to its density-based core structure.

	- Handles varying density both between clusters and within the same cluster via a flexible neighborhood–distance mechanism.

	- Robust against outliers and noisy samples.

	- Capable of clustering high-dimensional datasets.

	- Performs well on imbalanced datasets.

	- Achieves high clustering quality across multiple evaluation metrics.

	- Effectively identifies neck-type (bottleneck-shaped) clusters.
