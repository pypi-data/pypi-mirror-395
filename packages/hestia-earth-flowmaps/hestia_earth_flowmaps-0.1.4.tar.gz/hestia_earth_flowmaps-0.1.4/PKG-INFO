# HESTIA Flow Maps

This repository contains "FlowMaps" that map to/from HESTIA glossary terms, to/from "Flows" from other glossaries/nomenclatures.

The mappings are stored in a standardised csv file format as defined by the GLAD project. [GLAD repository UNEP-Economy-Division](https://github.com/UNEP-Economy-Division/GLAD-ElementaryFlowResources) described here [FlowMapping.md](https://github.com/UNEP-Economy-Division/GLAD-ElementaryFlowResources/blob/master/Formats/FlowMapping.md)
This format is compatible with the [USEPA format](https://github.com/USEPA/fedelemflowlist) described here [USEPA FlowMapping.md](https://github.com/USEPA/fedelemflowlist/blob/master/format%20specs/FlowMapping.md)

Please use the template file [FlowMapping.csv](https://github.com/UNEP-Economy-Division/GLAD-ElementaryFlowResources/blob/master/Formats/FlowMapping.csv) when creating new mappings.

**HAZARD WARNING**

Most of the flowmaps in this repo are "Beta" and have _not_ been verified or validated yet.

Once a flowmap within a file has been verified, the verifier will update the `Verifier` and `MemoVerifier` columns for each flowmap.
