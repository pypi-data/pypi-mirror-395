                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and

              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing
              the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,

           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,

              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# MRS-Inspector v1.0 — Structured Reasoning Trace Engine
*A companion module to the Modular Recursion Scaffold (MRS), providing full visibility into reasoning steps, execution flow, and exceptions.*

## Overview
MRS-Inspector records *every step* of a function’s execution — calls, nested calls, phases, inputs, outputs, and exceptions — into a structured trace object.  
It is designed to work alongside **Modular Recursion Scaffold (MRS)** as its interpretability and debugging layer.

Where MRS provides **structure**,  
MRS-Inspector provides **visibility**.

You can use MRS-Inspector to:

- instrument any Python function
- view internal reasoning flow
- collect nested call hierarchies
- capture exceptions with full traceback
- export traces to JSON
- reload traces for offline analysis or visualization

This enables research-grade transparency for small models, agents, recursive systems, or any code where reasoning steps matter.

---

# 1. Core Concepts

## 1.1 State Nodes
Every recorded event is a **State** — a dataclass containing:

- `id` (UUID)
- `module_name`
- `phase` (“call”, “phase”, “root”)
- `inputs`
- `outputs`
- `exception`
- `parent_id`
- `depth`
- `timestamp`

States form a **tree** that mirrors actual execution.

---

## 1.2 Trace Object
The `Trace` class stores all states and provides:

- ordered state list  
- lookup by ID  
- JSON save/load  
- compatibility with visualization tools

---

## 1.3 Call Stack Model
A lightweight stack keeps track of active states.  
Nested calls automatically become **children** of their callers.

---

# 2. Instrumentation Modes

## 2.1 `@inspector.wrap` — Function Instrumentation
Wrap any function to automatically record:

- its inputs  
- its output  
- nested calls inside it  
- exceptions  

Example:

```python
@inspector.wrap
def compute(x):
    return x * 2
```

Nested functions wrapped with `.wrap` automatically chain into the same trace.

---

## 2.2 Phases — `with inspector.phase(name)`
Phases are logical reasoning segments inside a function.

```python
with inspector.phase("retrieve"):
    docs = index.search(query)
```

Each phase becomes its own State node, allowing **semantic segmentation** of reasoning.

---

## 2.3 Root Execution — `inspector.inspect(fn)`
Runs a top-level function and returns `(result, trace)`:

```python
result, trace = inspector.inspect(main_fn)
```

This creates the root of the trace tree.

---

# 3. Exception Capture

All exceptions — including nested ones — are captured with:

- type  
- message  
- full traceback  

Example stored format:

```json
{
    "type": "ZeroDivisionError",
    "message": "division by zero",
    "traceback": "Traceback (most recent call last)..."
}
```

Exceptions **do not break the trace**.  
They become part of it.

---

# 4. JSON Export / Import

Save any trace:

```python
trace.save_json("trace.json")
```

Load a trace:

```python
loaded = Trace.load_json("trace.json")
```

Useful for:

- offline analysis  
- visualization tools  
- interpretability experiments  
- dataset generation  

---

# 5. Minimal Example

```python
from mrs_inspector import Inspector

inspector = Inspector()

@inspector.wrap
def squared(x):
    return x * x

def main():
    with inspector.phase("setup"):
        value = squared(3)
    return value + 1

result, trace = inspector.inspect(main)
trace.save_json("trace.json")
```

Resulting trace will contain:

- root execution  
- setup phase  
- call to `squared`  
- returned values  
- timestamps and structure  

---

# 6. What MRS-Inspector Enables

### Interpretability
A structured understanding of how a model, agent, or recursive system produced its output.

### Debugging
Exact reproduction of:

- the call structure  
- intermediate values  
- exceptions  
- execution order  

### Reasoning Analysis
Turn any function (or agent) into a *transparent reasoning pipeline*.

### Reusability & Offline Work
Share traces across systems or store them as part of datasets.

---

# 7. Roadmap

### v1.0 (Current)
- full call tracing  
- nested call support  
- exception recording  
- phases  
- JSON export/import  
- stable state tree representation  

### v1.1
- performance profiling  
- time-delta metrics  
- per-state memory footprint  

### v2.0
- graph visualization tools  
- HTML trace viewer  
- integration with MRS advanced recursion mode
