    HIGHLY RECOMMENDED: Enable agentic graph search for intelligent, context-aware

    identifying specific entities from your memory graph, then performing targeted
    searches. Examples: 'customer feedback' → identifies your customers first, then
    finds their specific feedback; 'project issues' → identifies your projects
    first, then finds related issues; 'team meeting notes' → identifies team members
    first, then finds meeting notes. This provides much more relevant and
    comprehensive results. Set to false only if you need faster, simpler
    keyword-based search.
