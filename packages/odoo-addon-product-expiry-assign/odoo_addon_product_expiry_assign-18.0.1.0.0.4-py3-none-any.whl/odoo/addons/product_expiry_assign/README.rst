Starting from Odoo 18.0, ``product_expiry`` module is blocking the
reservation of expired lots.

However we could have use cases where we want to move such expired lots
in another location.

Usage
=====

This module allows to force the reservation of expired lots with:

- a configuration option (at the company level)
- a context key

Configuration option (global)
-----------------------------

Open Inventory settings (*Inventory/Configuration/Settings*), section
*Traceability*, and enable option *Ignore Expiration Date*.

With context key (code)
-----------------------

Before calling ``<stock.move>._action_confirm()`` or
``<stock.move>._action_assign()``, one could set the
``ignore_expiration_date`` context key:

.. code:: python

   move_expired_lot._action_assign()
   assert move_expired_lot.state == "confirmed"
   move_expired_lot.with_context(ignore_expiration_date=True)._action_assign()
   assert move_expired_lot.state == "assigned"
