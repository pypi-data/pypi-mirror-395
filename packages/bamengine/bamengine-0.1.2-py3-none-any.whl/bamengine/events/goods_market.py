"""
Goods market events for consumption decisions and shopping.

This module defines the goods market phase events that execute after production.
Households calculate consumption propensity, allocate income to spending,
select firms to visit, and purchase goods through sequential shopping rounds.

Event Sequence
--------------
The goods market events execute in this order:

1. ConsumersCalcPropensity - Calculate propensity to consume based on savings
2. ConsumersDecideIncomeToSpend - Allocate income to spending budget
3. ConsumersDecideFirmsToVisit - Select firms to visit (sorted by price)
4. ConsumersShopOneRound - Execute shopping (repeated max_Z times)
5. ConsumersFinalizePurchases - Move unspent budget back to savings

The shopping rounds are repeated max_Z times to allow consumers to visit
multiple firms and find the best deals.

Design Notes
------------
- Events operate on consumer and producer roles (Consumer, Producer)
- Propensity to consume: c = 1 / (1 + tanh(SA/SA_avg)^β)
- Loyalty rule: consumers visit previous largest producer first (if inventory available)
- Consumers sorted by price (ascending) to prefer cheaper goods
- Shopping order randomized each round for fairness

Examples
--------
Execute goods market events:

>>> import bamengine as be
>>> sim = be.Simulation.init(n_firms=100, n_households=500, seed=42)
>>> # Goods market events run as part of default pipeline
>>> sim.step()

Execute individual goods market event:

>>> event = sim.get_event("consumers_calc_propensity")
>>> event.execute(sim)
>>> sim.con.propensity.mean()  # doctest: +SKIP
0.65

Check consumption:

>>> total_spent = sim.con.total_spent.sum()
>>> total_spent  # doctest: +SKIP
2850.0

@event
class ConsumersCalcPropensity:
    """
    Calculate marginal propensity to consume based on relative savings.

    Households with below-average savings have higher propensity to consume
    (spend more), while those with above-average savings have lower propensity
    (save more). This implements consumption smoothing behavior.

    Algorithm
    ---------
    For each consumer j:

    1. Calculate relative savings: :math:`r_j = SA_j / \\overline{SA}`
    2. Apply propensity function: :math:`c_j = 1 / (1 + \\tanh(r_j)^\\beta)`

    Mathematical Notation
    ---------------------
    .. math::
        c_j = \\frac{1}{1 + \\tanh\\left(\\frac{SA_j}{\\overline{SA}}\\right)^\\beta}

    where:

    - :math:`c_j`: propensity to consume (:math:`0 < c_j < 1`)
    - :math:`SA_j`: current savings of consumer j
    - :math:`\\overline{SA}`: average savings across all consumers
    - :math:`\\beta`: sensitivity parameter controlling consumption response (config)

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import bamengine as be
    >>> sim = be.Simulation.init(n_households=500, seed=42)
    >>> event = sim.get_event("consumers_calc_propensity")
    >>> event.execute(sim)

    Check propensity distribution:

    >>> sim.con.propensity.mean()  # doctest: +SKIP
    0.65

    Verify range:

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> (sim.con.propensity > 0).all() and (sim.con.propensity < 1).all()
    True

    High-savers have lower propensity:

    >>> high_savers = sim.con.savings > sim.con.savings.mean()
    >>> low_savers = sim.con.savings < sim.con.savings.mean()
    >>> sim.con.propensity[low_savers].mean() > sim.con.propensity[high_savers].mean()
    True

    Notes
    -----
    This event must execute first in goods market phase.

    Propensity is bounded: 0 < c < 1 (consumers always save something, always spend something).

    Higher β increases sensitivity to relative savings position.

    Allocate wealth to spending budget based on propensity to consume.

    Consumers combine their savings and income into total wealth, then allocate
    a portion to spending based on their propensity. The remainder stays as savings.

    Algorithm
    ---------
    For each consumer j:

    1. Calculate wealth: :math:`W_j = SA_j + I_j`
    2. Allocate to spending: :math:`B_j = W_j \\times c_j`
    3. Update savings: :math:`SA_j = W_j - B_j`
    4. Reset income: :math:`I_j = 0`

    Consumers select firms to visit, sorted by price (cheapest first).

    Consumers with spending budget build a shopping queue by sampling firms

    the firm they bought most from last period (if inventory available).

    Algorithm
    ---------
    For each consumer j with B_j > 0 (spending budget):

    1. Sample min(max_Z, n_firms_with_inventory) firms randomly
    2. Sort sampled firms by price (ascending - prefer cheaper)

    Notes
    -----
    This event must execute after ConsumersDecideIncomeToSpend (need spending budget).

    Algorithm

    Notes
    -----
    This event must execute after ConsumersDecideFirmsToVisit (need shopping queues).

    This event is typically repeated max_Z times to process all shopping rounds.

    Shopping order randomized each round to prevent systematic bias (e.g., low-ID
    consumers always shopping first).

    Consumers can partially exhaust inventory: if firm has less than requested
    quantity, consumer buys what's available and moves to next firm.
