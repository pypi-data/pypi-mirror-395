bugfixes:
  - >-
    ``ansible.builtin.pip`` - Running the built-in pip module with ``check_mode`` and packages coming from VCS URLs, archives, or local filepaths now correctly outputs the ``changed`` status of the task.
    Previously, it was always reported as changed due to improper package name resolution.
