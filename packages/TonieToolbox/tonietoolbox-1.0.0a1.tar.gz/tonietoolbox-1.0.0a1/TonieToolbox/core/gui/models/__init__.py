"""
GUI Models for TonieToolbox.

This module contains data models and state management classes for the PyQt6 GUI.
Models handle application state, player state, and UI data representation following
the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. State transitions are managed through
immutable data structures and event-driven updates.
