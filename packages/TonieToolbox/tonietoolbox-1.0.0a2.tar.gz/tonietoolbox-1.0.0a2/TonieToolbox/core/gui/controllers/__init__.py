"""
GUI Controllers for TonieToolbox.

This module contains controller classes that coordinate between GUI components (views)
and business logic (models). Controllers handle user interactions, orchestrate workflows,
and manage the communication between different parts of the application following the
MVC pattern. Event-driven architecture ensures loose coupling between components.
