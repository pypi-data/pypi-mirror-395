"""Pytest plugin for automatic test generation from story assertions.

This plugin automatically discovers stories with assertions and generates
pytest test items for each assertion, eliminating the need for manual test
boilerplate while providing excellent developer experience.

Key Features:
- Automatic test discovery from configured story paths
- One test item generated per assertion in each story
- Clear test naming: test_story[catalog.section.subject.story_name::assertion_name]
- Rich failure reporting with unified HTML diffs
- Fresh rendering per test for proper isolation
- Works with pytest-xdist for parallel execution

Configuration:
    Add paths to pytest's testpaths and optionally control the plugin:

    [tool.pytest.ini_options]
    testpaths = ["tests", "examples/"]  # pytest scans these paths

    [tool.storyville.pytest]
    enabled = true  # Enable/disable plugin (default: true)
