    """Validate that there are no output path collisions between static folders.

    This function checks that no two static folders would be copied to the same
    output location. Due to path preservation and source type disambiguation
    (storyville_static/ vs static/), collisions should never happen in practice.
    However, this validation provides a safety check and helpful error messages.

    Args:
        static_folders: List of StaticFolder instances to validate

    Raises:
        ValueError: If a collision is detected between two folders

    Example:
        >>> from pathlib import Path
        >>> from storyville.static_assets.models import StaticFolder
        >>> folders = [
        ...     StaticFolder(Path("a/static"), "storyville", Path("a")),
        ...     StaticFolder(Path("b/static"), "input_dir", Path("b")),
        ... ]
        >>> validate_no_collisions(folders)  # No collision - different prefixes

    Note:
        - Collisions are virtually impossible due to:
          1. Full path preservation (components/nav vs components/button)
          2. Source type disambiguation (storyville_static/ vs static/)
        - This function is defensive programming for unexpected edge cases
