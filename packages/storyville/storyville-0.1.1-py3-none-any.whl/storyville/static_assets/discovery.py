    """Discover all static folders recursively under the given base path.

    This function scans the directory tree starting from base_path and finds all
    directories named "static". For each discovered folder, it creates a StaticFolder
    instance with the necessary metadata for copying.

    The function uses Path.rglob("**/static") to recursively find all static
    directories, similar to how make_site scans for stories.py files.

    Args:
        base_path: The root directory to scan for static folders
        source_type: Whether scanning "storyville" core or "input_dir"

    Returns:
        List of StaticFolder instances representing discovered folders

    Example:
        >>> from pathlib import Path
        >>> folders = discover_static_folders(
        ...     Path("src/storyville"),
        ...     "storyville"
        ... )
        >>> len(folders) > 0
        True
        >>> folders[0].source_type
        'storyville'

    Note:
        - Only directories named exactly "static" are discovered
        - Empty static folders are included in the results
        - The relative_path preserves the full path structure for collision prevention
