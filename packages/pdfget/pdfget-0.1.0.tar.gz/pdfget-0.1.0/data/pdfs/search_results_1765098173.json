      "abstract": "This beginner's guide is intended for plant biologists new to network analysis. Here, we introduce key concepts and resources for researchers interested in incorporating network analysis into research, either as a stand-alone component for generating hypotheses or as a framework for examining and visualizing experimental results. Network analysis provides a powerful tool to predict gene functions. Advances in and reduced costs for systems biology techniques, such as genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics, have generated abundant omics data for plants; however, the functional annotation of plant genes lags. Therefore, predictions from network analysis can be a starting point to annotate genes and ultimately elucidate genotype-phenotype relationships. In this paper, we introduce networks and compare network-building resources available for plant biologists, including databases and software for network analysis. We then compare four databases available for plant biologists in more detail: AraNet, GeneMANIA, ATTED-II, and STRING. AraNet and GeneMANIA are functional association networks, ATTED-II is a gene coexpression database, and STRING is a protein-protein interaction database. AraNet and ATTED-II are plant-specific databases that can analyze multiple plant species, whereas GeneMANIA builds networks for <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> and nonplant species and STRING for multiple species. Finally, we compare the performance of the four databases in predicting known and probable gene functions of the <i>A. thaliana</i> Nuclear Factor-Y (NF-Y) genes. We conclude that plant biologists have an invaluable resource in these databases and discuss how users can decide which type of database to use depending on their research question.",

      "abstract": "Plants are critical for sustaining human life and planetary health. However, their potential to enable humans to survive and thrive beyond Earth remains unrealized. This Viewpoint presents a collective vision outlining priorities associated with plant science to support a new frontier of human existence. These priorities are drawn from the International Space Life Sciences Working Group (ISLSWG) Plants for Space Exploration and Earth Applications workshop, held at the European Low Gravity Research Association (ELGRA) conference in September 2024. First, we highlight transformative advances gained from using the 'laboratory of space' in understanding how plants respond to gravity and other stressors. Second, we introduce a new crop Bioregenerative Life Support System (BLSS) readiness level (BRL) framework - extending the existing Crop Readiness Level (CRL) - to assist in overcoming challenges to establish resilient, sustainable crop production. Materializing the vision of plants as enablers of space exploration will require innovative approaches, including predictive modeling, synthetic biology, robust Earth-based analogue systems, and reliable space-based instruments to monitor biological processes. Success relies upon a unified international community to promote sharing of resources, facilities, expertise, and data to accelerate progress. Ultimately, this work will both advance human space exploration and provide solutions to enhance sustainable plant production on Earth.",
