      "abstract": "<b>Objective:</b> To summarize the clinicopathological features, evolving trends in treatment and surgical approaches, and survival outcomes of patients who underwent D2 radical gastrectomy for gastric cancer in Shanxi Provincial Cancer Hospital over the past 11 years with the goal of providing a reference for the clinical practice of gastric cancer in this region. <b>Methods:</b> A retrospective observational study was conducted to analyze the clinicopathological data of patients who underwent D2 radical gastrectomy for pathologically confirmed gastric malignancy at the Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, Shanxi Provincial Cancer Hospital from January, 2013 to December, 2023. Exclusion criteria consisted of: (1) residual gastric cancer or recurrent gastric cancer after surgery; (2) emergency gastric cancer resection due to bleeding, perforation, obstruction, or other causes; (3) comorbidity with other primary malignant tumors; (4) severe preoperative cardiopulmonary insufficiency or hepatic and renal insufficiency who cannot tolerate radical surgery; and (5) inconsistent main diagnosis information across the medical record system, pathological system, and gastric cancer-specific database. Patients were divided into three groups based on treatment methods: the surgery-only group, the perioperative chemotherapy group, and the adjuvant chemotherapy group. Endpoints included: (1) baseline patient characteristics; (2) trends in tumor location and pathological features; (3) evolution of treatment modalities; and (4) survival outcomes. <b>Results:</b> A total of 15,644 patients were included in the analysis, with 12,591 males and 3,053 females, the male-to-female gender ration was approximately 4∶1; the mean age was (61.2±9.5) years. The tumor sites were mainly concentrated in the esophagogastric junction (EGJ) (57.4%), followed by the antrum (25.9%). The incidence of EGJ cancer initially rose and then declined. However, gastric antrum tumors remained stable, and gastric body tumors showed a slow upward trend after 2020, accounting for 16.7%. In terms of pathological types, poorly differentiated carcinoma was the most prevalent, accounting for 55.9%, followed by moderately differentiated carcinoma (24.2%), mucinous adenocarcinoma (or signet ring cell carcinoma,14.1%), neuroendocrine carcinoma (4.8%), and well-differentiated carcinoma (0.9%). The proportion of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma showed a significant upward trend overall as well, peaking at 65.6% in 2022 and decreasing to 57.5% in 2023. Mucinous adenocarcinoma (or signet ring cell carcinoma) exhibited fluctuations with a first increase followed by a decrease: it peaked at 17.3% in 2018, dropped sharply to 8.4% in 2022, and rose back to 13.8% in 2023. The proportions of well-differentiated adenocarcinoma, moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, and neuroendocrine tumors remained stable year by year. In terms of pathological staging, the overall proportions of gastric cancer at Stage 0, Stage I, Stage II, Stage III, and Stage IVa were 0.5%, 17.3%, 25.1%, 54.9%, and 2.3%, respectively. For Stage III, its proportion was 74.6% in 2013, which decreased to 46.4% by 2023. Stages I and II gastric cancer showed an upward trend, with their proportions rising from 10.2% and 12.1% in 2013 to nearly 21.0% and 29.6% in 2023, respectively. Between 2013 and 2023, the proportion of patients who received surgery alone continued to decrease, with this proportion dropping to 34.7% in 2023. In contrast, the number of patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy increased year by year, reaching 54.2% in 2023. Since 2017, the application of perioperative chemotherapy has gradually increased, rising to 11.1% in 2023. Immunotherapy showed an almost synchronous growth trend with perioperative chemotherapy. However, targeted therapy exhibited a downward trend after a period of growth. There were 10,704 cases of open surgery (68.4%), 4,744 cases of laparoscopic surgery (30.3%), and 193 cases of transthoracic surgery (1.2%). Pathological margin positivity was observed in 443 cases (2.8%), and the volume of gastric cancer surgeries gradually increased, peaked in 2021 before subsequently decreasing gradually. However, the volume of laparoscopic surgeries did not decrease; instead, it showed an upward trend. The main resection method for EGJ tumors was total gastrectomy, accounting for 78.5% of the total, followed by proximal gastrectomy, which accounted for 21.5%. After total gastrectomy, esophagojejunal Roux-en-Y anastomosis was the primary anastomotic method, and for proximal gastrectomy, the main anastomotic method was esophagogastric anastomosis, which accounted for 68.0% of the total. For distal gastrectomy, Billroth II anastomosis was the most common anastomotic technique, accounting for 92.7% of these procedures. The overall incidence of postoperative complications was 14.5% (2,264/15,644), among which the incidence of severe complications (grades III-IV) was 4.5% (706/15,644). The entire cohort was followed up with for (47.1±36.8) months, and the 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year overall survival rates were 86.4%, 65.9%, and 58.1%, respectively. For patients with stage 0, I, II, III, and IV gastric adenocarcinoma, the 1-year overall survival rates were 95.7%, 98.0%, 89.4%, 81.0%, and 49.1%, respectively; the 3-year overall survival rates were 92.1%, 94.6%, 81.9%, 51.4%, and 14.7%, respectively; and the 5-year overall survival rates were 89.4%, 91.7%, 75.1%, 41.5%, and 10.0%, respectively. For patients with stage I, II, III, and IV gastric neuroendocrine carcinoma, the 1-year overall survival rates were 96.7%, 91.1%, 73.8%, and 52.6%, respectively; the 3-year overall survival rates were 87.2%, 69.6%, 46.1%, and 32.1%, respectively; and the 5-year overall survival rates were 87.2%, 62.2%, 36.7%, and 32.1%, respectively. <b>Conclusions:</b> Gastric cancer in Shanxi Province is characterized by a male predominance, a high prevalence of tumors at the esophagogastric junction, a large proportion of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, and presentation at advanced stages (predominantly Stage III). The detection rate of early gastric cancer has been increasing year by year, the volume of laparoscopic surgeries has been on the rise annually, and the treatment model has shifted from single surgery to comprehensive treatment.",

      "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>Ovarian cancer contributes significantly to the morbidity and mortality rates for women worldwide. As observed with other types of cancer, health disparities disproportionately affect ovarian cancer incidence rates and outcomes, especially in African American and older women. However, the trends in ovarian cancer mortality rates up until 2023 with regard to various demographic identifiers have not been fully elucidated, which this study aims to rectify.<h4>Methods</h4>Mortality trends due to malignant neoplasms of the ovary in individuals 25 and older in the US from 1999 to 2023 were analyzed using the Centers for Disease Control Wide Ranging Online Data for Epidemiological Research (CDC WONDER) database. Trends in age-adjusted mortality rate (AAMR) were analyzed on the basis of race, 10-year age-group, region and urban/rural designation.<h4>Results</h4>Between 1999 and 2023, the AAMR related to malignant neoplasms of the ovary fell from 14.62 in 1999 to 9.52 in 2023. All races analyzed saw a decrease in overall mortality related to malignant neoplasms of the ovary, with the largest decrease being observed in White patients (AAPC: -1.78). Regionally, the Northeast (AAPC: -1.95), Midwest (AAPC: -1.99), South (AAPC: -1.72), and West (AAPC: -1.73) regions of the United States (US) all saw reduced ovarian neoplasm mortality rates. Similarly, rates also decreased in urban (AAPC: -1.83) and rural (AAPC: -1.75) localities, as well as in each ten-year age category analyzed, with the largest decrease seen in the 55-64 years old category (AAPC: -2.15). States such as Delaware, South Carolina, and Idaho experienced some of the largest decreases in AAMR, whereas the District of Columbia saw an increase in AAMR during this period.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Over the last twenty-years, mortality rates for malignant neoplasms of the ovary have declined, with the largest decreases being seen in White patients, those residing in the Midwest, urban locality, and women between 55-64 years olds. While mortality rates have declined, health disparities still continue to negatively affect ovarian cancer outcomes, and more research is needed to improve accessibility, availability, and affordability of care for patients.",

Patients were classified into groups A, B, and E, and the initial inhalation therapy recommendations were revised. This study aimed to investigate the application status of initial inhalation therapy recommendations in patients with COPD and determine whether adherence to the GOLD 2023 report could achieve a better prognosis.<h4>Methods</h4>This was a prospective cohort study. Demographic data, COPD assessment test (CAT) and modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) scores, pulmonary function, GOLD grades, GOLD groups, number of exacerbations, comorbidities, and inhalation therapy were collected. The patients were classified into adherent and non-adherent groups based on the provision of initial inhalation therapy recommendations that aligned with the GOLD A, B, and E groupings. All patients finished one year of follow-up to collect data on the number of exacerbations and mortality.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 1654 patients were enrolled, of whom 816 (49.3%) were in the adherent group. The patients in the adherent group had higher age, CAT and mMRC scores, and number of exacerbations and hospitalisations, higher proportion of combined with lung cancer and chronic heart disease, and worse pulmonary function. Patients in the adherent group had lower future exacerbations, frequent exacerbations, and hospitalisations. The patients in groups B and E who adhered to the GOLD 2023 report had lower future exacerbations, frequent exacerbations, and hospitalisations, while no significant difference was observed in group A (P < 0.05).<h4>Conclusions</h4>In the real world, many patients with COPD do not receive the initial inhalation therapy recommended by the GOLD 2023 report. However, adherence to the GOLD 2023 report may decrease the risk of future exacerbation. It implied that improved the dissemination and uptake of GOLD 2023 recommendations is needed in the clinical practice.",

      "abstract": "<h4>Background/objectives</h4>Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 and worse (CIN3+) is a robust surrogate for cervical cancer risk. In Norway, organized cervical screening starts at 25 years of age (25-69 years). Norway introduced school-based HPV vaccination with the quadrivalent vaccine for 12-year-old girls in 2009 (birth cohorts ≥ 1997) with high 3-dose completion, and a catch-up program with the bivalent vaccine for women born 1991-1996 in 2016-2019 with lower uptake. We assessed whether increasing birth-cohort vaccination coverage (defined as ≥1 dose) was followed by reductions in CIN3+ at the age of entry to organized screening (25-29 years).<h4>Methods</h4>We conducted a retrospective, population-based time-series of women aged 25-29 years in Troms and Finnmark screened in 2010-2024. CIN3+ was counted per unique woman and expressed per 1000 screened women per year. Cohort-level vaccination exposure was proxied by birth-year eligibility and national coverage (≥1 dose) by calendar year. Temporal trends were assessed using segmented linear regression (2010-2017; 2017-2024).<h4>Results</h4>Among 42,253 screening tests, 865 women had CIN3+. CIN3+ rates were stable in 2010-2016 (≈15-24 per 1000), peaked in 2017-2018 (≈26-28 per 1000), and declined to 6.6 per 1000 in 2024 (~75% reduction from the peak). The 2010-2017 trend was not significant (<i>p</i> = 0.244), whereas 2017-2024 showed a significant annual decline (slope -3.04 per 1000 per year; <i>p</i> = 7.4 × 10<sup>-5</sup>). The decline coincided with an increase in the vaccinated share of the age group from an estimated 12% in 2017 to 78% in 2024. Cervical cancer was rare throughout and absent in 2024, and the 2023 transition to primary HPV testing did not interrupt the downward trend.<h4>Conclusions</h4>As vaccinated birth cohorts-especially those vaccinated before sexual debut-entered organized screening at age 25, CIN3+ in women aged 25-29 years fell markedly. Estimates are based on coverage defined as ≥1 dose; future linkage to individual dose data and HPV type-specific CIN3+ is warranted.",

      "abstract": "BackgroundMalignant neoplasms remain a major public health concern in Thailand, as in several countries. There is limited research that has explored long-term sex-specific trends utilizing national hospital-based data. MethodsThis retrospective descriptive study examines 17 years of inpatient data obtained from publicly available sources from the Ministry of Public Health website, focusing on nine malignancy groups and 31 malignant neoplasm subtypes, classified by ICD-10 codes. The study aims to provide important insights into sex-specific patterns by presenting prevalence rates, illustrating trends, and differences between males and females over time.ResultsThe study revealed clear differentiation between sexes. Both males and females had the highest prevalence rates for ill-defined or secondary cancers (males:361.39; females: 379.33 per 100,000 population) by 2023. However, the subsequent ranking differed by sex. In males, the next most prevalent cancers over 100 per 100,000 population were gastrointestinal (GI) cancers, including liver (141.20), colon (139.53), and rectosigmoid junction and related organ cancers (111.70). In contrast, for females, breast cancer (184.58) and colon cancer (119.30), respectively, ranked highest.ConclusionsThis 17-year study highlights sex differences in cancer hospitalizations in Thailand, with men more affected by gastrointestinal, lung, and blood cancers, and women by breast and reproductive malignancies. The findings support targeted health policies and cancer health promotion and prevention efforts.",

Joinpoint analysis shows a decrease in mortality in the last five years, being greater in urban areas. For 2023, the highest mortality occurred in Sonora and Chihuahua, while Mexico City (-0.71; 95%CI -0.98 to -0.44) was the entity that showed a significant reduction in the mortality rate from breast cancer. The spatial analysis showed a local indicator of spatial association of 0.458 (p<0.05) for 2000 and 0.524 (p<0.05) for 2023 in the northern states of the country.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Public health interventions must be implemented according to the social, economic, and cultural context to reduce mortality from breast cancer.",

      "abstract": "While several anti-tumor biosimilars have been approved in China, comprehensive nationwide analyses of their real-world utilization patterns remain limited, particularly regarding cross-regional adoption and indication-specific usage. We collected information on patients treated with bevacizumab, rituximab, trastuzumab and their biosimilars at 109 hospitals in nine Chinese cities from 2019 to 2023. Analysis of 264,527 prescriptions revealed rapid biosimilar adoption for bevacizumab (2023 originator share: 20.0%, -25.1%/year), moderate for rituximab (32.1%, -16.8%/year), and limited for trastuzumab (70.0%, -8.3%/year). Geographic variation was substantial (2023 city ranges: bevacizumab 2.3-43.0%; rituximab 6.7-70.3%; trastuzumab 42.4-92.4%). Tertiary hospitals showed faster biosimilar uptake than secondary hospitals (bevacizumab: + 23.7%). Free medical care patients preferred originators (bevacizumab: 64.1% vs 38-39% for other payers). Off-label use demonstrated significantly higher biosimilar adoption (bevacizumab: 69.0%; rituximab: 52.1%) versus approved indications (p < 0.00625). Cost distributions mirrored prescription trends but consistently favored originators. All trends were statistically significant (p < 0.05). The biosimilar market share showed steady annual growth, however the growth rates vary across different products. However, Patients with lower out-of-pocket costs remained more likely to choose original products. Enhanced regulatory oversight of both approved and off-label/extrapolated indications is needed to ensure appropriate biosimilar utilization.",

      "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>This study aimed to develop and validate a radiologic clustering model using CT imaging features to stratify clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) patients by prognosis and identify key imaging predictors of 5-year progression free survival (PFS).<h4>Methods</h4>This retrospective study included 164 ccRCC patients with multiphase kidney CT and next-generation sequencing (NGS) between September 2003 and October 2024. Qualitative imaging features were extracted, and unsupervised consensus clustering was performed to classify tumors based on radiologic characteristics. A nomogram-based C1 score was derived from features predictive of the high-risk cluster. Model performance was evaluated using C-index and 5-year area under the receiver operating curve (AUC). Genetic alterations and copy number variations (CNVs) were also analyzed for associations with imaging features and survival.<h4>Results</h4>Clustering revealed two distinct radiologic subtypes. Cluster C1 characterized by aggressive behavior such as tumor heterogeneity (p = 0.011), exophytic growth pattern (p = 0.002), non-smooth margin (p = 0.019), and renal sinus extension (p = 0.016), and was independently associated with poorer 5-year PFS (p = 0.018). The C1 score demonstrated an AUC of 0.992 for predicting cluster C1 in the test-set. Using a cutoff of 0.75, the model achieved 96.3% sensitivity and 96.4% specificity. For predicting 5-year PFS, the C1 score showed moderate performance (AUC 0.65; C-index 0.65), which improved when combined with nodal/distant metastasis and BAP1 mutation status (AUC 0.71; C-index 0.67).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Radiologic clustering using CT features enables non-invasive prognostic stratification of ccRCC. The C1 score derived from this approach may serve as a practical tool to guide surveillance and treatment decisions.<h4>Trial registration</h4>Retrospectively registered.",

      "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) is common, affecting approximately 15% of patients with cancer. Over recent years, there have been significant changes in both the diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for the condition, and recent epidemiological studies have shown improvements in survival across most major cancer types. However, it is currently unclear whether there has been an increase in survival in patients with MPE.<h4>Methods</h4>Medical records of patients diagnosed with MPE between 2015 and 2023 at Oxford University Hospitals were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were split into groups of equal size based on the date of MPE diagnosis and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were performed. Subgroup analyses were conducted in patients with MPE by causative cancer type, performance status at diagnosis and treatment with systemic anti-cancer therapy. Cox regression analyses were carried out using the individual year of MPE diagnosis as an included variable.<h4>Results</h4>742 patients with MPE were included. There was no improvement in survival length in patients managed in more recent years. This was consistent across effusions secondary to any primary malignancy; effusion secondary to lung cancer, mesothelioma or breast cancer; in patients with better performance status; and in patients who received systemic anti-cancer therapy.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Despite recent changes in the management of MPE and improving survival trends in cancer overall, survival time following the development of MPE appears to have remained stagnant over the 8-year time period under study. This suggests that MPE should potentially be considered as a discrete clinical entity, necessitating investigation of oncological therapies specifically targeted to the pleural space.",

Method The first page data of the medical record cancer patient from January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2023 were collected from the medical records homepage management and statistical analysis system of a tertiary hospital in Sichuan Province.The influencing factors of hospitalization costs were statistically analyzed by Univariate and multiple linear regeression analysis. Results A total of 12161 cancer inpatients were included in the analysis from 2019 to 2023. Among the main cancer cost, diagnostic services(pathology, laboratory, imaging and clinical diagnostics) and pharmaceuticals (Western,Traditional Chinese medicine) constituted the largest cost components (29.35% and 26.02%), respectively. Length of stay (LOS),surgical intervention, and clinical pathway implementation significantly predicted costs (all P < 0.05).Cancer type, disease outcome, discharge year, and payment method showed partial effects, though statistical significance varied across reference subgroups. Conclusion High hospitalization costs exacerbate financial burdens in cancer care.Strengthening the whole process management of diagnosis and treatment of patients from admission to discharge, to reduce the waiting time of patients before surgery and average length of hospitalization, and the hospitalization cost of patients with malignant tumors can be reduced.</p>",

      "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>While radiotherapy (RT) improves breast cancer survival outcomes, concerns persist regarding radiation-induced cardiovascular complications. We aimed to evaluate the incidence and risk of radiation-associated cardiovascular disease (CVD) among breast cancer survivors.<h4>Methods</h4>This population-based retrospective cohort study included 38,045 female breast cancer survivors in South Korea who survived at least 1 year following diagnosis between 2012 and 2019. Cumulative incidence of CVD was estimated using the cumulative incidence function accounting for competing risks. Hazard ratios (HRs) for radiation-associated CVD were calculated using cause-specific Cox proportional hazards models with adjustments for potential confounders.<h4>Results</h4>Among the study population, 67.8% received RT. The RT group was younger at diagnosis, had fewer distant-stage cancers, and lower prevalence of pre-existing cardiovascular conditions compared to the non-RT group. The 9-year cumulative incidence of overall CVD was 32.8%, with higher rates in the non-RT group. RT was not significantly associated with increased risk of overall heart disease (HR: 0.94; 95% CI 0.88-1.01) or specific subtypes. No significant differences were observed between RT techniques. While no significant interaction was observed between RT and chemotherapy for overall heart disease risk (p = 0.2641), a significant interaction was identified for heart failure (p = 0.0013); patients receiving both RT and chemotherapy exhibited an increased risk (HR: 1.31; 95% CI 1.03-1.65) compared to those receiving neither treatment.<h4>Conclusions</h4>RT was not significantly associated with increased overall CVD risk, nor were there significant differences based on RT technique or its combination with chemotherapy for most cardiac outcomes. However, combined RT and chemotherapy significantly elevated heart failure risk, suggesting a potential interaction effect. Given the relatively short follow-up period, cautious interpretation of these results is warranted.",

      "abstract": "<h4>Purpose</h4>While several countries reported an impact of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic on cancer incidence in 2020, little is known about trends in the following years. This study examined changes in cancer incidence in Baden-Württemberg between 2015 and 2023.<h4>Methods</h4>Data from the Baden-Württemberg Cancer Registry were used to calculate age-standardized and age-specific incidence rates for all cancers combined and for colorectal, lung, prostate, and breast cancer. Incidence rates for 2020 to 2023 were compared with those from a pre-pandemic reference period (2017-2019) and with expected rates based on modeled trends between 2015 and 2019 using standardized incidence ratios (SIRs).<h4>Results</h4>Among men, the age-standardized overall cancer incidence declined significantly from 734.0 per 100,000 in 2019 to 672.9-681.7 during 2020-2023. In women, incidence declined from 542.2 in 2019 to 504.3-524.4, with statistically significant reductions in 2022 and 2023. Compared to 2017-2019 levels, 14,214 fewer cases (-5.5%) were diagnosed in 2020-2023; relative to model-based expectations, 19,525 fewer cases (-7.6%) were reported. Site-specific analyses showed significantly lower colorectal cancer incidence in both sexes from 2020 onwards (SIRs: 0.81-0.90). For men, part of this decline may reflect a pre-existing downward trend. No significant deviations were found for lung and prostate cancer. Female breast cancer incidence was significantly lower only in 2020 (SIR: 0.93).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Cancer incidence in Baden-Württemberg remained consistently below pre-pandemic and expected levels from 2020 through 2023. Further research is warranted to disentangle potential contributing factors, including post-pandemic effects, competing mortality risks, and migration-related population changes.",

The objectives of this study were to estimate recent societal costs of breast cancer in Sweden and provide population-based patient-level cost estimates for health economic evaluations.<h4>Methods</h4>This prevalence-based cost-of-illness study was based on 2019 data linking multiple Swedish national registers. The analysis employed a societal perspective considering direct health care, informal care, and productivity losses. Total costs were estimated using a bottom-up micro-costing approach. Direct costs per patient-year were also estimated by subgroups, including age group, breast cancer subtype, breast cancer stage at diagnosis, and disease state defined by metastatic status.<h4>Findings</h4>82,960 breast cancer patients diagnosed since 2008 were alive by the end of 2019. The annual societal cost of breast cancer in Sweden was €632 million, where the direct health care, informal care, and productivity losses accounted for 37 %, 5 %, and 57 %, respectively. The cost per capita was €61. Costs of direct health care, including inpatient/outpatient care and prescribed drugs, varied by subgroups, where younger age, higher stage, and more adverse subtypes were associated with higher costs per patient-year. Patients with a diagnosis of de novo metastatic cancer incurred the highest mean cost per patient-year.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Breast cancer represents a large economic burden in Sweden. The mean cost estimates per patient-year are informative to future health economic evaluations for breast cancer screening and treatment.",
