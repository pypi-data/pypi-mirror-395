      "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing oncology, with deep learning (DL) emerging as a pivotal technology for addressing gynecologic malignancies (GMs). DL-based models are now widely applied to assist in clinical diagnosis and prognosis prediction, demonstrating excellent performance in tasks such as tumor detection, segmentation, classification, and necrosis assessment for both primary and metastatic GMs. By leveraging radiological (e.g., X-ray, CT, MRI, and Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT)) and pathological images, these approaches show significant potential for enhancing diagnostic accuracy and prognostic evaluation. This review provides a concise overview of deep learning techniques for medical image analysis and their current applications in GM diagnosis and outcome prediction. Furthermore, it discusses key challenges and future directions in the field. AI-based radiomics presents a non-invasive and cost-effective tool for gynecologic practice, and the integration of multi-omics data is recommended to further advance precision medicine in oncology.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the integration of topological data analysis (TDA) techniques with deep learning (DL) models to improve breast cancer diagnosis from ultrasound images. By leveraging persistent homology, a TDA method that captures global structural patterns, we enrich the local spatial features typically learned by DL models. We in-corporate topological features into various pre-trained architectures, including CNNs and vision transformers (VTs), aiming to enhance screening accuracy for breast cancer, which remains the most common cancer among women. Experiments on publicly available ultrasound datasets demonstrate that combining CNNs and VTs with topological features consistently yields statistically significant performance improvements. Notably, this approach also helps to address challenges faced by DL models, such as interpretability and reliance on large labeled datasets. Further-more, we generalize the Alexander duality theorem to cubical persistence, showing that persistent homology remains invariant under sublevel and superlevel filtrations for image data. This advancement reduces computational costs, making TDA methods more practical for image analysis.",
