      "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>The auxin response factor (ARF) is a key regulator involved in plant growth, development, and stress response. In this study, we systematically identified the ARF gene family using a pan-genomic approach based on 47 high-quality potato genomes.<h4>Results</h4>Among the 28 members of the potato ARF pan-gene family, no core or private genes were identified. Only one gene was classified as near-core, while the remaining genes were considered non-essential. Ka/Ks analysis indicated that a single gene was under positive selection, whereas the rest of the family members were subject to purifying selection. Structural variations across the 21 potato genomes did not significantly alter the expression of ARF pan-gene family members, and no notable expression differences were detected. However, these structural variations did lead to changes in conserved domains in certain strains. RNA-seq analysis revealed differential expression of ARF family members under drought stress compared to control conditions, with variation in expression levels among different genes. Further investigation suggested that transcription factors are involved in regulating the expression of ARF gene family members.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our findings revealed the function of the auxin response-factor family members in biological processes in potato, and provide a new theoretical reference for drought resistance-breeding in this important crop species.",

      "abstract": "The basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors are central regulators of plant growth and stress responses. This study presents a pan-genome analysis of bZIP genes across nine Cucurbitaceae species: cucumber, watermelon, melon, bitter gourd, bottle gourd, wax gourd, monk fruit, snake gourd, and <i>Herpetospermum pedunculosum</i>. We cataloged 502 bZIPs (350 core, 151 dispensable) in 12 subfamilies. Intron variation was the primary source of intrasubfamily diversity; core-only subfamilies showed lower polymorphism and stronger purifying selection. Core bZIPs mainly originated from whole-genome/segmental duplication, while dispensable bZIPs expanded via small-scale duplication. Integrating 393 transcriptomes revealed that both core and dispensable <i>bZIP</i>s contribute to development and abiotic-stress responses, with dispensable members more specifically hormone-induced and core <i>bZIP</i>s engaging broader gene-interaction networks. This pan-genome survey delineates bZIP genomic architecture, evolutionary dynamics, and functional specialization in Cucurbitaceae, providing a robust resource for downstream mechanistic studies and molecular breeding.",

      "abstract": "Pan-genome analysis is a crucial method for studying genomic dynamics. By creating pan-genome maps for prokaryotic organisms, we can gain valuable insights into their genetic diversity and ecological adaptability. However, current analytical methods often struggle to balance accuracy and computational efficiency, and they tend to provide primarily qualitative results. This study introduces PGAP2, an integrated software package that simplifies various processes, including data quality control, pan-genome analysis, and result visualization. PGAP2 facilitates the rapid and accurate identification of orthologous and paralogous genes by employing fine-grained feature analysis within constrained regions. Our systematic evaluation with simulated and gold-standard datasets demonstrates that PGAP2 is more precise, robust, and scalable than state-of-the-art tools for large-scale pan-genome data. Furthermore, PGAP2 introduces four quantitative parameters derived from the distances between or within clusters, enabling detailed characterization of homology clusters. Finally, we validate our quantitative findings by applying PGAP2 to construct a pan-genomic profile of 2794 zoonotic Streptococcus suis strains. This analysis offers new insights into the genetic diversity of S. suis, thereby enhancing our understanding of its genomic structure.

Walp.) is an Africa-originated legume providing a vital source of protein for millions across resource constrained areas of Africa, Asia and Latin America. Understanding genetic diversity in cowpea is pivotal to its genetic improvement. Here, we assembled 20 high-quality genomes representing cowpea global diversity and constructed a graph-based pan-genome to characterize genetic variation. The pan-genome comprises 29,557 orthogroups, with approximately 73% conserved across all accessions. Extensive structural variations (SVs) were uncovered, affecting thousands of coding sequences and gene expression. Notably, thousands of SVs were found under selection between two cowpea subspecies, highlighting their roles in subspecies divergence. We pinpointed key SVs underlying variation in pod length and seed number per pod. Two SV clusters appeared to modulate pod length through altering expression and function of  <italic>VuWAK</italic>  and  <italic>VuGA2ox2</italic>  genes. These findings provide insights into cowpea genetic diversity and establish a fundamental resource for cowpea genetic improvement.  </p>",

      "abstract": "Decoding the language of DNA sequences is a fundamental problem in genome research. Mainstream pre-trained models like DNABERT-2 and Nucleotide Transformer have demonstrated remarkable achievements across a spectrum of DNA analysis tasks. Yet, these models still face the pivotal challenge of (1) genetic language diversity, or the capability to capture genetic variations across individuals or populations in the foundation models; (2) model efficiency, specifically how to enhance performance at scalable costs for large-scale genetic foundational models; (3) length extrapolation, or the ability to accurately interpret sequences ranging from short to long within a unified model framework. In response, we introduce DeepGene, a model leveraging Pan-genome and Minigraph representations to encompass the broad diversity of genetic language. DeepGene employs the rotary position embedding to improve the length extrapolation in various genetic analysis tasks. On the 28 tasks in Genome Understanding Evaluation, DeepGene achieves the overall best score. DeepGene outperforms other cutting-edge models for its compact model size and superior efficiency in processing sequences of varying lengths. The datasets and source code of DeepGene are available at GitHub (https://github.com/wds-seu/DeepGene).",

      "abstract": "The promising biocontrol agent <i>Brevibacillus brevis</i> is a broadly dispersed bacterium exhibiting significant antibacterial properties against plant diseases. This study conducted a comprehensive comparative genomic analysis of 25 <i>B. brevis</i> strains to examine their taxonomic classification, genetic diversity, and biocontrol potential. The genome sizes, excluding strain NEB573, varied from 5.95 to 6.73 Mb, with GC content between 47.0% and 47.5%. Notably, strain NEB573 exhibited distinct genomic characteristics based on Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI), digital DNA-DNA hybridisation (dDDH), and phylogenetic analyses, suggesting it may represent a novel <i>Brevibacillus</i> species pending additional phenotypic confirmation. The remaining 24 strains were grouped into six phylogenetic clades. The pan-genome study demonstrated significant genomic flexibility, demonstrating an open architecture with 2855 core gene families (33.08%) and 1699 distinct genes. Functional annotations indicated that unique genes were enriched in tasks related to DNA repair and environmental adaptation, while core genes predominantly participated in amino acid metabolism and transcription. The examination of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) identified multiple antimicrobial compounds, such as gramicidin and tyrocidine, which have been reported to exhibit both antibacterial and antifungal activities, thereby underscoring the broad-spectrum biocontrol potential of <i>B. brevis</i>. These findings endorse the application of biocontrol in sustainable plant disease management and offer novel perspectives on its genetic basis in <i>B. brevis</i>. Future investigations of its metabolic repertoire may unveil novel agro-biotechnological applications.",

Here, we provide a wheat pan-transcriptome with de novo annotation and differential expression analysis for these wheat cultivars across multiple tissues. Using the de novo annotations we identify cultivar-specific genes and define the core and dispensable genomes. Expression analysis across cultivars and tissues reveals conservation in expression between a large core set of homeologous genes, in addition to widespread changes in subgenome homeolog expression bias between cultivars and cultivar-specific expression profiles. We utilise both the newly constructed gene-based wheat pan-genome and pan-transcriptome, demonstrating variation in the prolamin superfamily and immune-reactive proteins across cultivars.",
