      "abstract": "<p>The increasing use of AI-based approaches such as machine learning (ML) across diverse scientific fields presents challenges for reproducibly disseminating and assessing research. As ML becomes integral to a growing range of computationally intensive applications (e.g. clinical research), there is a critical need for transparent reporting methods to ensure both comprehensibility and the reproducibility of the supporting studies. There are a growing number of standards, checklists and guidelines enabling more standardized reporting of ML research, but the proliferation and complexity of these make them challenging to use. Particularly in assessment and peer review, which has to date, been an ad hoc process that has struggled to throw light on increasingly complicated computational supporting methods that are otherwise unintelligible to other researchers. Taking the publication process beyond these black boxes, GigaScience Press has experimented with integrating many of these ML-standards into the publication process. Having a broad-scope that necessitated looking at more generalist and automated approaches. Here, we map the current landscape of artificial intelligence (AI) standards, and outline our adoption of the DOME recommendations for Machine Learning in biology. We developed a publishing workflow that integrates the DOME Data Stewardship Wizard and DOME Registry tools into the peer-review and publication process. From this case study we provide journal authors, reviewers and Editors examples of approaches, workflows and strategies to more logically disseminate and review ML research. Demonstrating the need for continued dialogue and collaboration among various ML communities to create unified, comprehensive standards, to enhance the credibility, sustainability and impact of ML-based scientific research.</p>",
