"""Sample and synthetic agar plate images for fungal colony testing.

Provides loaders and generators for representative plate scenes used in demos,
benchmarks, and tests: synthetic single colonies, synthetic full plates, time-course
captures at 12–72 hours, early low-contrast crops, and smear-plate examples. Utilities
return arrays or ready-to-use `Image`/`GridImage` objects for rapid pipeline trials.
