"""Prefab pipelines for fungal colony plate processing.

Ready-to-run chains of enhancement, detection, refinement, and measurement steps
tuned for common agar plate scenarios. Includes watershed-heavy pipelines for
clustered colonies, Otsu-based pipelines for clean backgrounds, grid-section pipelines
for tiled inputs, and grid-aware Gitter-style processing for dense arrays.
