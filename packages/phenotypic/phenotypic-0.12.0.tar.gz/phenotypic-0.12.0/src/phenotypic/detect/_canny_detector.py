class CannyDetector(ThresholdDetector):
    """
    Canny edge-based object detection for microbial colonies.

    Applies the Canny edge detector to identify colony boundaries, then labels
    the enclosed regions as individual objects. The Canny algorithm uses a
    multi-stage process: Gaussian smoothing, gradient calculation, non-maximum
    suppression, and hysteresis thresholding to produce thin, connected edges
    that robustly delineate colony perimeters even in noisy or unevenly
    illuminated images.

    Use cases (agar plates):
    - Detect well-separated colonies with clear boundaries on solid media where
      edge sharpness dominates over intensity differences.
    - Handle plates with variable illumination or low contrast that challenge
      intensity-based thresholding (e.g., translucent colonies on light agar).
    - Segment colonies with heterogeneous internal texture or pigmentation that
      might fragment under watershed or simple thresholding.
    - Robustly trace colony perimeters when background subtraction is imperfect
      or when agar texture is pronounced.

    Caveats:
    - Canny assumes objects are defined by edges. Colonies with very diffuse or
      gradual boundaries (e.g., fuzzy/mucoid colonies) may yield incomplete or
      fragmented edges, resulting in under-segmentation or missed objects.
    - Overlapping or touching colonies may be outlined as a single contiguous
      edge, causing multiple colonies to merge into one object. Pre-blur or
      increase sigma to regularize boundaries, or use watershed refinement post-
      detection to split merged regions.
    - Threshold tuning is critical: too aggressive and noise dominates, too
      conservative and colony boundaries vanish. use_quantiles=True often
      provides a safer starting point.
    - Does not inherently handle intensity-based segmentation; if colonies differ
      mainly in brightness (not edges), consider Otsu or watershed instead.
    - May detect plate edges, dust, or scratches as spurious boundaries. Use
      min_size filtering and ensure clean agar surfaces or pre-mask the plate
      region if needed.

    Attributes:
        sigma (float): Standard deviation for Gaussian smoothing applied before
            edge detection, controlling pre-smoothing intensity. Higher values
            reduce noise sensitivity and suppress spurious edges from agar
            granularity or scanner artifacts, but may blur fine colony
            boundaries or merge nearby colonies if set too high. Start with 1–2
            for high-resolution images; increase for noisier scans.
        low_threshold (float): Lower bound for hysteresis thresholding.
            Raising this suppresses weak edges from noise or faint texture but
            may fragment colony boundaries if edges are dim. Lowering it
            recovers more boundary detail but risks false edges. If
            use_quantiles=True, this is a fraction (0–1) of gradient values; if
            False, an absolute gradient magnitude.
        high_threshold (float): Upper bound for hysteresis thresholding.
            Strong edges above this seed the edge traces; too high and faint
            colonies lose boundaries, too low and noise creates spurious edges.
            Adjust relative to low_threshold to control edge connectivity.
        use_quantiles (bool): When True, thresholds are interpreted as
            quantiles of the gradient distribution (e.g., 0.1 = 10th
            percentile), making behavior more robust to image-specific
            intensity ranges. When False, thresholds are absolute gradient
            magnitudes, requiring manual tuning per imaging setup.
        min_size (int): Minimum pixel area to retain as an object after
            labeling regions enclosed by edges. Increase to remove dust,
            debris, or imaging artifacts; decrease to capture very small
            colonies. Setting too high discards genuine small colonies.
        invert_edges (bool): If True (default), regions *between* edges (i.e.,
            enclosed areas) are labeled as objects, suitable for detecting
            solid colonies. When False, edges themselves are labeled (useful
            for atypical cases like ring-shaped colonies or debugging edge
            quality).
        connectivity (int): Connectivity level for labeling regions (1 for
            4-connected, 2 for 8-connected in 2D). Higher connectivity merges
            diagonally adjacent pixels into the same object, which can join
            fragmented colony regions but may also merge nearby colonies
            touching at corners.

        Parameters:
            sigma (float): Gaussian smoothing strength before edge detection. Start
                with 1-2 for clean images; increase for noisy scans to suppress
                spurious edges. Keep below typical colony radius to avoid merging.
            low_threshold (float): Lower hysteresis threshold. If use_quantiles=True,
                a fraction (e.g., 0.1 = retain edges stronger than 10% of gradients).
                If False, an absolute gradient magnitude. Increase to suppress weak
                edges from noise; decrease to recover faint colony boundaries.
            high_threshold (float): Upper hysteresis threshold. Seeds edge traces.
                If use_quantiles=True, a fraction (e.g., 0.2 = top 80% gradients);
                if False, an absolute magnitude. Raise to focus on strong boundaries;
                lower to include fainter edges. Must exceed low_threshold.
            use_quantiles (bool): Interpret thresholds as quantiles (True, default)
                or absolute values (False). Quantiles adapt to image contrast
                automatically, reducing manual tuning.
            min_size (int): Minimum object area in pixels. Increase to filter out
                dust, debris, and small artifacts; decrease to retain tiny colonies.
            invert_edges (bool): If True (default), label enclosed regions as
                objects (colonies). If False, label edge pixels (for atypical cases
                like ring colonies or edge quality checks).
            connectivity (int): Connectivity for labeling regions (1 or 2 in 2D).
                Higher values merge diagonally touching pixels, useful for bridging
                fragmented boundaries but may merge touching colonies.
