class MeasureTexture(MeasureFeatures):
    """Measure colony surface texture using Haralick features from gray-level co-occurrence matrices.

    This class extracts second-order texture features (Haralick features) from colony grayscale images,
    quantifying surface roughness, regularity, and directional patterns. Features are computed at specified
    pixel offsets (scales) and across four directional angles (0°, 45°, 90°, 135°), then averaged.

    **Intuition:** Colony texture reflects mycelial structure, growth patterns, and physiological state.
    Smooth, glabrous colonies have low texture contrast and entropy. Wrinkled, powdery, or sporulated
    colonies exhibit high contrast and energy. Radial growth patterns show angular correlation; random
    growth shows low correlation. Texture metrics capture morphological complexity beyond area and
    perimeter, enabling fine-grained phenotypic discrimination.

    **Use cases (agar plates):**
    - Distinguish wild-type smooth colonies from rough/wrinkled mutants (e.g., Bacillus subtilis biofilm
      morphologies, Pseudomonas aeruginosa rough variants).
    - Detect sporulation and powdery growth via high contrast and entropy.
    - Assess mycelial organization in fungi: organized radial hyphae (high correlation) vs diffuse cottony
      growth (low correlation).
    - Identify growth stress or nutrient depletion via texture changes within the same strain over time.
    - Enable multi-feature clustering combining size, shape, color, and texture for robust phenotyping.

    **Caveats:**
    - Haralick features depend on image quantization level (quant_lvl); lower levels (8) reduce texture
      nuance but are faster; higher levels (64) capture detail but are sensitive to noise.
    - Scale parameter affects the neighborhood size; small scales (1-2 px) capture fine texture (mycelial
      threads), large scales (5-10 px) capture coarse patterns (overall wrinkles). No single scale is
      universal; use multiple scales and average or compare within-plate.
    - Texture metrics are sensitive to uneven illumination and shadow; preprocess with illumination
      correction or histogram equalization if images show strong gradients.
    - Enhancement (rescale_intensity) improves texture detail but can inflate contrast in low-variance
      regions (e.g., uniform smooth colonies); use judiciously and validate with manual inspection.
    - Computation is slow for large colonies and high quantization levels; optimize scale and quant_lvl
      for your specific assay.

    Attributes:
        scale (list[int]): Distance parameter(s) for Haralick co-occurrence matrix, typically 1–10 pixels.
            Larger values capture coarse texture; smaller values capture fine detail.
        quant_lvl (Literal[8, 16, 32, 64]): Gray-level quantization (number of bins). Lower values
            (8, 16) reduce dimensionality and computation time; higher values (32, 64) preserve texture
            nuance but increase noise sensitivity.
        enhance (bool): Whether to rescale intensity within each colony to [0,1] before Haralick
            computation. Improves contrast in low-variance regions but can bias comparisons. Defaults to False.
        warn (bool): Whether to issue warnings if Haralick computation fails for specific objects.
            Failures typically occur with very small colonies or empty regions. Defaults to False.

    Returns:
        pd.DataFrame: Object-level texture measurements with columns:
            - Label: Unique object identifier.
            - Texture measurements by scale and direction: AngularSecondMoment-deg000-scale##,
              Contrast-deg045-scale##, ..., Correlation-avg-scale##, etc.
            - 13 Haralick features × 4 angles = 52 directional columns per scale.
            - Final 13 columns: averages across angles for each feature at the given scale.
