"""Feature extraction from detected fungal colonies.

Computes per-colony and grid-level metrics describing growth, morphology, and
appearance on agar plates. Measurements span bounds, size/integrated intensity,
shape descriptors, texture, color, and grid-level statistics such as spatial spread
and linear gradients. Results are returned as pandas DataFrames ready for analysis.
