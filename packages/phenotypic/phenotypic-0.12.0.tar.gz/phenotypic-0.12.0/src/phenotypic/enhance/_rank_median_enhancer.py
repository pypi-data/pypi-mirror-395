class RankMedianEnhancer(ImageEnhancer):
    """
    Rank-based median filtering with configurable footprint.

    Applies a local median using rank filters with a user-defined footprint
    shape and radius. For agar plate colony images, this enables targeted
    suppression of impulsive noise while tailoring the spatial scale to colony
    size and shape, offering more control than a default median.

    Use cases (agar plates):
    - Denoise while preserving colony boundaries by matching the footprint radius
      to be smaller than colony diameters.
    - Use anisotropic or non-circular footprints (e.g., squares) for grid-like
      artifacts from imaging hardware.

    Tuning and effects:
    - shape: Choose 'disk' for circular isotropic smoothing on plates;
      'square' or 'cube' can align with grid artifacts; 'ball' for 3D stacks.
    - radius: Controls neighborhood size. Larger radii remove more
      noise but can erode small colonies and close tight gaps.
    - shift_x/shift_y: Offset the footprint center to bias the neighborhood
      if imaging introduces directional streaks; typically left at 0.

    Caveats:
    - Very large footprints may over-smooth and merge nearby colonies.
    - Rank filters operate on uint8 here; intensity scaling occurs internally.
      Ensure consistency if comparing raw intensities elsewhere.

    Attributes:
        shape (str): 'disk', 'square', 'sphere', or 'cube' defining
            the footprint geometry.
        radius (int | None): Radius (pixels). If None, a small default
            derived from image size is used.
        shift_x (int): Horizontal footprint offset for advanced use.
        shift_y (int): Vertical footprint offset for advanced use.

                'sphere'/'cube' for 3D contexts. Default 'square'.
            radius (int | None): Neighborhood radius in pixels. Set
                smaller than the minimum colony radius to preserve colony edges;
                None chooses a small default based on image size.
            shift_x (int): Horizontal offset of the footprint center to bias the
                neighborhood if artifacts are directional. Typically 0.
