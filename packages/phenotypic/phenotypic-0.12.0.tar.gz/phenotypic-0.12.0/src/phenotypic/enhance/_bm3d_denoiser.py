class BM3DDenoiser(ImageEnhancer):
    """
    Block-matching and 3D collaborative filtering denoising for plate images.

    Applies BM3D, a state-of-the-art denoising algorithm that groups similar
    image patches and performs collaborative filtering in the transform domain.
    This is particularly effective for removing structured noise patterns and
    preserving fine colony details on agar plates (e.g., scanner artifacts,
    systematic CCD noise, or subtle textures from imaging hardware).

    Use cases (agar plates):
    - Remove structured camera/scanner noise while preserving sharp colony edges
      and fine morphological features (e.g., wrinkles, satellite colonies).
    - Suppress noise from low-light imaging or high ISO settings without the
      over-smoothing typical of simple Gaussian blur.
    - Pre-process before edge detection or feature extraction when image
      quality is poor but colony structures must remain intact.

    Tuning and effects:
    - sigma_psd: Estimated noise standard deviation in [0, 1] scale (matching
      normalized image range). Start with automatic estimation (None) or typical
      values 0.01-0.05 for moderate noise, 0.05-0.15 for very noisy images.
      For reference: 8-bit noise of σ=10/255 ≈ 0.04; 16-bit noise of σ=300/65535
      ≈ 0.005. Too low preserves noise; too high removes real colony texture.
    - stage_arg: Controls whether to run fast ('hard_thresholding') or complete
      ('all_stages') denoising. 'all_stages' produces cleaner results but is
      slower; 'hard_thresholding' is faster and often sufficient for plates.
    - Operates on normalized [0,1] float data directly from enh_gray.

    Caveats:
    - Computationally expensive, especially on high-resolution images. Consider
      downsampling or cropping for exploratory analysis.
    - Requires accurate `sigma_psd` estimate in [0, 1] scale. If unknown, use
      None for auto-estimation or test multiple values to avoid under/over-
      denoising. Noise magnitude differs between 8-bit and 16-bit originals.
    - Does not correct illumination gradients; combine with background
      subtraction (e.g., `GaussianSubtract`, `RollingBallRemoveBG`) if needed.
    - May slightly blur very fine colony features if sigma_psd is too high.

    Attributes:
        sigma_psd (float | None): Noise standard deviation in [0, 1] normalized
            scale. If None, BM3D auto-estimates from the image. Typical values:
            0.01-0.05 for moderate noise (e.g., 8-bit with σ=5-15), 0.05-0.15
            for heavy noise. 16-bit images typically have lower relative noise.
        stage_arg (Literal["all_stages", "hard_thresholding"]): Processing mode.
            'all_stages' applies both hard thresholding and Wiener filtering
            (slower, highest quality); 'hard_thresholding' runs only the first
            stage (faster, good for most plates).
