class GridAccessor(ImageAccessorBase):
    """Provides grid-based access and analysis for microbial colony arrays on agar plates.

    This class facilitates operations on grid structures within a GridImage, enabling analysis
    of robotically-pinned microbial colonies arranged in a regular rectangular array pattern.
    It provides methods for determining grid properties, retrieving colony information by grid
    location, and visualizing grid overlays with row and column assignments.

    The grid divides an agar plate image into a regular matrix of sections, each potentially
    containing one or more detected colonies. The grid is ordered left-to-right, top-to-bottom
    when using flattened indexing.

    Attributes:
        nrows (int): Number of rows in the grid (read/write property). Corresponds to the
            number of row pins in a colony pinning robot. Must be >= 1.
        ncols (int): Number of columns in the grid (read/write property). Corresponds to the
            number of column pins in a colony pinning robot. Must be >= 1.
