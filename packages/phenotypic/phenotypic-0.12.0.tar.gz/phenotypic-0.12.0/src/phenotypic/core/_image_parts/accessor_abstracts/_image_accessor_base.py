        Adds labels to objects in an image plot. This method overlays numerical labels onto

        This functionality is particularly useful in microbiology image analysis where
        different colonies need to be identified and studied individually. Adjusting certain

                and visibility of the text against the image, which might be critical when
                distinguishing labels on different background or media types used.
            size (int): The font size of the label text. Larger values make the labels more
                prominent, useful for densely populated plates or distant views, whereas smaller
                values add discretion and are better for crowded colonies or finer details.
            facecolor (str): The background color of the label's text box. This can help to
                enhance text contrast, especially when visualizing colonies with similar colors
                as the text. An opaque background makes labels clearer when overlapping colonies.
            object_label (None | int): If `None`, all objects are labeled. Setting a specific
                integer labels only the corresponding object. Modifying this allows targeted
                labeling, which simplifies results for cases focusing on individual colonies
                with unique interest.
            **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments passed to `matplotlib.axes.Axes.text()`
                that control text rendering properties such as rotation, alignment, or weight,
                providing flexibility in presentation.
