class SmallObjectRemover(ObjectRefiner):
    """Remove small, likely spurious objects from a labeled object map.

    Intuition:
        After thresholding/segmentation of agar-plate images, tiny specks from
        dust, condensation, camera noise, or over-segmentation can appear as
        separate labeled objects. Removing these below a minimum size reduces
        false positives and stabilizes downstream phenotyping.

    Use cases (agar plates):
        - Clean up salt-and-pepper detections before measuring colony size or
          shape.
        - Suppress fragmented debris around large colonies that may bias
          counts or area statistics.
        - Post-processing step after aggressive enhancement/thresholding.

    Tuning and effects:
        - min_size: Sets the minimum object area (in pixels). Increasing this
          value removes more small fragments, typically improving mask quality
          and background suppression, but may also delete legitimate micro-
          colonies when colonies are extremely small or underexposed.

    Caveats:
        - Setting ``min_size`` too high can remove small but real colonies or
          early-time-point growth, reducing recall.
        - The optimal threshold depends on resolution; what is “small” at
          high-resolution imaging may be substantial at low resolution.
