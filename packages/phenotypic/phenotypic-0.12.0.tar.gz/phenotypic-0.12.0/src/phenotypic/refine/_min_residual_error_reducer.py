class MinResidualErrorReducer(GridObjectRefiner):
    """Reduce multi-detections per grid cell by keeping objects closest to a
    linear-regression prediction of expected positions.

    Intuition:
        In grid assays, some cells contain multiple detections due to halos,
        debris, or over-segmentation. By modeling the expected colony position
        in each row/column with linear regression, we can retain the object with
        the smallest residual error (closest to the predicted location) and
        remove the rest. This iterates across the grid until each cell is
        simplified.

    Why this is useful for agar plates:
        Pinned arrays assume consistent spatial layout. Selecting the object
        nearest the learned grid trend eliminates off-grid artifacts while
        preserving the most plausible colony per cell.

    Use cases:
        - Over-segmentation yields several blobs per grid position.
        - Condensation or glare introduces extra detections near a colony.

    Caveats:
        - If the grid fit is inaccurate (bad registration, warped plates), the
          closest-to-trend object may not be the true colony.
        - Relatively slow due to repeated measurement and iteration over cells.
