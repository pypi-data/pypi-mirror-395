"""Mask refinement for detected fungal colonies.

Post-detection operations that clean up binary masks by removing artifacts, fixing gaps,
and normalizing colony footprints across grid cells. Tools cover circularity checks,
size filtering, border exclusion, center deviation reduction, hole filling, morphological
opening, tophat-based brightening, oversized-object capping, residual-based outlier removal,
skeletonization, and thinning.
