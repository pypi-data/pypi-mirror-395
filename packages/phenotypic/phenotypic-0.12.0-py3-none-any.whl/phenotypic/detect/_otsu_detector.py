    This class inherits from the `ThresholdDetector` and provides the functionality
    to apply Otsu's thresholding method on the enhance matrix (`enh_gray`) of an
    arr image. The operation generates a binary mask (`objmask`) depending on the
    computed threshold other_image.

        apply: Applies Otsu's thresholding on the arr image object and modifies its
            omask attribute accordingly.

        automatically determined using Otsu's method. The resulting binary
        mask is stored in the image's `objmask` attribute.
