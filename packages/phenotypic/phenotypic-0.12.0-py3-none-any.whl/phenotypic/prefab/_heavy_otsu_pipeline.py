    The HeavyWatershedPipeline class is a composite image processing pipeline that combines multiple layers of preprocessing, detection, and filtering steps
    that can will select the right colonies in most cases. This comes at the cost of being a more computationally expensive pipeline.

    Pipeline Steps:
        1. Gaussian Smoothing
        2. CLAHE
        3. Median Enhancement
        4. Watershed Segmentation
        5. Border Object Removal
        6. Grid Oversized Object Removal
        7. Minimum Residual Error Reduction
        8. Grid Alignment
        9. Repeat Watershed Segmentation
        10. Repeat Border Object Removal
        11. Repeat Minimum Residual Error Reduction
        12. Mask Fill

    Measurements:
        - Shape
        - Color
        - Texture
        - Intensity

        Initializes the object with a sequence of operations and measurements for image

        parameters allow for adjusting the processing pipeline for specific use cases such
        as image segmentation and feature extraction.

            gaussian_truncate (float): Truncate filter at this many standard deviations.
            otsu_ignore_zeros (bool): Whether to ignore zero pixels in Otsu thresholding.
            otsu_ignore_borders (bool): Whether to ignore border objects in Otsu detection.
