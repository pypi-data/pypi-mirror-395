"""Abstract interfaces for fungal colony image operations.

Defines the base contracts that power the processing pipeline: enhancers, detectors,
refiners, grid operations, and measurement classes. Implement these to add new steps
tailored to agar plate imaging, building on `MeasurementInfo`, `MeasureFeatures`,
`ImageOperation`, `GridOperation`, and the prefab pipeline foundation.
