class MaskFill(ObjectRefiner):
    """Fill holes inside binary object masks to produce solid colonies.

    Intuition:
        Thresholding on agar-plate images can leave small voids inside colony
        masks due to illumination gradients, pigment heterogeneity, or glare.
        Filling these holes produces contiguous masks that better match the
        true colony footprint and improve area-based phenotypes.

    Why this is useful for agar plates:
        Many colonies exhibit darker centers or radial texture. Hole filling
        mitigates these within-colony gaps so that downstream measurements
        (area, perimeter, intensity summaries) are less biased.

    Use cases:
        - After global or adaptive thresholding where donut-like masks appear.
        - Prior to morphological measurements that assume simply connected
          shapes.

    Caveats:
        - Over-aggressive filling with a large structuring element can bridge
          adjacent colonies through narrow gaps, hurting separation.
        - If masks contain genuine cavities that should remain (e.g., hollow
          artifacts), filling may misrepresent structure.

    Attributes:
        structure (Optional[np.ndarray]): Structuring element used to define the
            neighborhood for filling. A larger or denser structure tends to
            close larger holes but can also smooth away fine boundaries.
        origin (int): Center offset for the structuring element. Adjusting the
            origin subtly shifts how neighborhoods are evaluated, which can
            influence edge behavior at colony boundaries.

    Examples:
        .. dropdown:: Fill holes in colony masks to produce solid shapes

            >>> from phenotypic.refine import MaskFill
            >>> op = MaskFill()
            >>> image = op.apply(image, inplace=True)  # doctest: +SKIP

        Args:
            structure (Optional[np.ndarray]): Binary structuring element. Larger

            origin (int): Origin offset for the structuring element. Typically
