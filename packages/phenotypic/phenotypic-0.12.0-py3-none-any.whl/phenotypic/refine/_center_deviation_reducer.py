class CenterDeviationReducer(ObjectRefiner):
    """Keep the object closest to center and remove off-center detections.

    Intuition:
        For isolated-colony images (e.g., single-spot captures or per-grid-cell
        crops), the true colony is typically near the center. Spurious blobs from
        glare, dust, or agar texture may appear off-center. This operation keeps
        only the object whose centroid is closest to the image center, removing
        all others.

    Why this is useful for agar plates:
        When imaging a grid of pinned colonies, per-cell crops may contain extra
        detections (ringing, condensation, halo). Selecting the most centered
        object stabilizes downstream phenotyping by focusing on the intended
        colony in each crop.

    Use cases:
        - Single-colony crops from a grid plate where occasional debris is picked
          up near edges.
        - Automated pipelines that assume one colony per field-of-view.

    Caveats:
        - If the true colony is notably off-center (misalignment, drift), this
          method can remove it and keep a distractor.
        - Not suitable for multi-colony fields; it will drop all but one object.
