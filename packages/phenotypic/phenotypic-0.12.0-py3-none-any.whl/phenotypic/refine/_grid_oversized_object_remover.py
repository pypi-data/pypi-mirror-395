class GridOversizedObjectRemover(GridObjectRefiner):
    """Remove objects that are larger than their grid cell allows.

    Intuition:
        In pinned colony grids, each cell should contain at most one colony of
        limited extent. Objects spanning nearly an entire cell width/height are
        often merged colonies, agar edges, or segmentation spillover. Removing
        these oversized objects improves the reliability of per-cell analysis.

    Why this is useful for agar plates:
        Grid-based assays assume spatial confinement. Oversized detections
        disrupt row/column statistics and bias growth comparisons. Filtering
        them stabilizes downstream measurements.

    Use cases:
        - Dropping merged blobs that span adjacent positions.
        - Removing strong edge artifacts near the plate rim that intrude into
          the grid.

    Caveats:
        - If genuine colonies expand to fill the cell (late time points), this
          remover may exclude real growth.
        - Highly irregular grids or mis-registered edges can cause over-
          removal; ensure grid metadata is accurate.

        Applies operations on the given GridImage to remove objects based on maximum width and height constraints.

        This method processes the grid metadata of a `GridImage` object to identify objects
        that exceed the maximum calculated width and height. It sets such objects to a
        background value of 0 in the object's mapping array. This helps filter out undesired
        large objects in the image.

            image (GridImage): The arr grid image containing grid metadata and object map.
