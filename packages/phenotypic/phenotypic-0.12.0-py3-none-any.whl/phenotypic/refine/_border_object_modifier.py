class BorderObjectRemover(ObjectRefiner):
    """Remove objects that touch the image border within a configurable margin.

    Intuition:
        Colonies that intersect the plate boundary or image crop edge are often
        partial, poorly segmented, and bias size/shape measurements. This
        operation zeroes any labeled objects in ``image.objmap`` whose pixels
        fall within a user-defined border band, ensuring only fully contained
        colonies are analyzed.

    Why this is useful for agar-plate imaging:
        Plate crops or grid layouts frequently clip edge colonies. Removing
        border-touching objects stabilizes downstream phenotyping (area,
        circularity, intensity) and prevents partial colonies from contaminating
        statistics or training data.

    Use cases:
        - Single-plate captures where the plate rim truncates colonies.
        - Grid assays where wells or positions near the frame boundary are
          partially visible.
        - Automated crops that shift slightly between frames, cutting off
          colonies at the margins.

    Caveats:
        - A large border may remove valid edge colonies (lower recall). Too
          small a border may retain partial objects.
        - With very tight crops (little background), even modest margins can
          eliminate many colonies.

    Attributes:
        border_size (int): Width of the exclusion border around the image.

    Examples:
        .. dropdown:: Remove objects that touch the image border within a margin

            >>> from phenotypic.refine import BorderObjectRemover
            >>> op = BorderObjectRemover(border_size=15)
            >>> image = op.apply(image, inplace=True)  # doctest: +SKIP
            >>> # All colonies intersecting a 15-pixel frame margin are removed

    Raises:
        TypeError: If an invalid ``border_size`` type is provided (raised during
            operation when parameters are validated).

        Args:
            border_size: Width of the exclusion border around the image.
                - ``None``: Use a default margin equal to 1% of the smaller
                  image dimension.
                - ``float`` in (0, 1): Interpret as a fraction of the minimum
                  image dimension, producing a resolution-adaptive margin.
                - ``int`` or ``float`` ≥ 1: Interpret as an absolute number of
                  pixels.

        Notes:
            Larger margins remove more edge-touching colonies and are useful
            when crops are loose or the plate rim intrudes. Smaller margins
            preserve edge colonies but risk including partial objects.
