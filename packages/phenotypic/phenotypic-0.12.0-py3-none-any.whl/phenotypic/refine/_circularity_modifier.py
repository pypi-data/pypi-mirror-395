class LowCircularityRemover(ObjectRefiner):
    """Remove objects with circularity below a specified cutoff.

    Intuition:
        Single bacterial/fungal colonies on agar often appear approximately
        round. Irregular, elongated, or fragmented shapes can indicate merged
        colonies, scratches, agar texture, or segmentation errors. Filtering by
        circularity keeps well-formed colonies and removes unlikely shapes.

    Why this is useful for agar plates:
        Circular colonies produce more reliable area and intensity measurements.
        Removing low-circularity detections reduces bias from streaks, debris,
        or incomplete segmentation near plate edges and grid borders.

    Use cases:
        - Post-threshold cleanup to exclude elongated artifacts or merged
          colonies before counting or phenotyping.
        - Enforcing morphology consistency in high-throughput grid assays.

    Caveats:
        - Some colonies are intrinsically irregular (wrinkled, spreading,
          filamentous). A high cutoff may incorrectly remove these phenotypes.
        - Perimeter estimates on low-resolution masks can be noisy, slightly
          biasing the circularity calculation.

    Attributes:
        cutoff (float): Minimum Polsby–Popper circularity required to keep an
            object, in [0, 1]. Higher values retain only near-circular shapes
            (sharper shape constraints) and can improve edge sharpness in the
            kept set but may reduce recall for irregular colonies.

    Examples:
        >>> from phenotypic.refine import LowCircularityRemover
        >>> op = LowCircularityRemover(cutoff=0.8)
        >>> image = op.apply(image, inplace=True)  # doctest: +SKIP

        Args:
            cutoff (float): Minimum allowed circularity in [0, 1]. Increasing
                the cutoff favors compact, round objects (often cleaner masks),

                debris or merged objects.
