class ResidualOutlierRemover(GridObjectRefiner):
    """Remove objects with large regression residuals in noisy grid rows/columns.

    Intuition:
        In grid assays, colony centroids should align along near-linear trends
        within each row/column. Rows or columns with high variability suggest
        mis-detections or artifacts. Within such noisy lines, this operation
        removes objects whose positional residuals exceed a robust cutoff.

    Why this is useful for agar plates:
        Condensation, glare, and debris can produce off-grid detections that
        inflate row/column variance and break gridding assumptions. Pruning
        residual outliers restores alignment and improves subsequent measures.

    Use cases:
        - Cleaning rows with multiple off-line blobs before measuring growth.
        - Stabilizing grid registration when a subset of positions is noisy.

    Caveats:
        - If true colonies deviate due to warping or growth spreading, strict
          cutoffs may remove real data.
        - Depends on reasonable initial grid fit; with severe misregistration
          it may prune valid colonies.

    Attributes:
        axis (Optional[int]): Axis to analyze for outliers. ``None`` analyzes
            both rows and columns; ``0`` analyzes rows; ``1`` analyzes columns.
            Restricting the axis can speed up processing or focus on suspected
            directions of error.
        cutoff_multiplier (float): Multiplier applied to a robust dispersion
            estimate (IQR-based in implementation) to set the outlier cutoff.
            Higher values are more permissive (fewer removals) and preserve
            edge cases; lower values prune more aggressively.
        max_coeff_variance (int): Maximum coefficient of variance (std/mean)
            allowed for a row/column before it is considered for outlier
            pruning. Smaller values trigger cleaning sooner; larger values only
            clean severely noisy lines.

        Args:
            axis (Optional[int]): Axis selection for analysis. ``None`` runs
                both directions; ``0`` rows; ``1`` columns. Limiting the axis
                reduces runtime and targets known problem directions.
            stddev_multiplier (float): Robust residual cutoff multiplier. Lower
                values remove more outliers (stronger cleanup) but risk dropping
                valid off-center colonies; higher values are conservative.
            max_coeff_variance (int): Threshold for row/column variability
                (std/mean) to trigger outlier analysis. Lower values clean more
                lines; higher values only address extremely noisy lines.
