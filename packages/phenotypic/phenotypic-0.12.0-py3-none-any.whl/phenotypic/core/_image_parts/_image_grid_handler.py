class ImageGridHandler(Image):
    """
    A specialized Image object that supports grid-based processing and overlay visualization.

    This class extends the base `Image` class functionality to include grid handling,
    grid-based slicing, and advanced visualization capabilities such as displaying overlay information
    with gridlines and annotations. It interacts with the provided grid handling utilities
    to determine grid structure and assign/overlay it effectively on the image.

    Args:
            arr (Optional[Union[np.ndarray, Type[Image]]]): The input_image
                image, which can be a NumPy array or an image-like object. If
                this parameter is not provided, it defaults to None.
            grid_finder (Optional[GridFinder]): An optional GridFinder instance
                for defining grids on the image. If not provided, it defaults to
                a center grid setter.
            nrows (int): An integer passed to the grid setter to specify the number of nrows in the grid
                (Defaults to 8).
            ncols (int): An integer passed to the grid setter to specify the number of columns in the grid
                (Defaults to 12).

    Attributes:
        grid_finder (Optional[GridFinder]): An object responsible for defining and optimizing the grid
            layout over the image, defaulting to an `OptimalCenterGridSetter` instance if none is provided.
        _accessors.grid (GridAccessor): An internal utility for managing grid-based operations such as
            accessing row and column edges and generating section maps for the image's grid system.
