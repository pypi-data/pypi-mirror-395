class ObjectsAccessor:
    """Provide access to detected microbial colonies and their properties in agar plate images.

    This accessor enables researchers to analyze individual colonies in arrayed microbial cultures
    after colony detection has been performed. It provides methods for accessing colony labels,
    retrieving colony properties (area, intensity, position), extracting individual colony crops,
    and organizing colony data for high-throughput phenotypic screening workflows.

    The accessor operates on labeled object maps where each pixel value indicates which colony it
    belongs to (0 for background, 1+ for individual colonies). Properties are computed using
    scikit-image's regionprops functionality, providing standardized morphological and intensity
    measurements for each colony.

    Note:
        This accessor can only be used after an ObjectDetector has been applied to the Image to
        identify and label individual colonies. Attempting to access before detection raises
        NoObjectsError.

    Attributes:
        _root_image (Image): The parent Image containing the labeled colony map (objmap).

        """Renumber colony labels to be sequential and contiguous.

        This method relabels all colonies in the object map so that labels are sequential
        integers starting from 1 (i.e., 1, 2, 3, ..., N for N colonies). This is useful
        after filtering or removing colonies, which can leave gaps in the label sequence,
        or when you need consistent, predictable label numbering for downstream analysis.

        The relabeling preserves the spatial relationships between colonies but assigns new
        labels in a consistent order. Connected components (colonies) are assigned sequential
        IDs based on their position in the label image.

        Returns:
            None: This method modifies the parent Image's objmap in-place. Labels are
                renumbered directly in the object map, and no value is returned.
