# The `cenreg` Package

The Python package `cenreg` is repository for probabilistic forecasts such as quantile regression and distribution regression and for censored regression such as survival analysis and interval-censored data analysis.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You first need to install `SurvSet` via pip
```
pip install SurvSet
```

Additionally, denpending on the models you want to use, you also need to install
+ LightGBM
+ PyTorch

### Installation

You can install `cenreg` via pip:
```
pip install cenreg
```

### Run Sample Code

You can find our sample codes in the `notebooks` directory.

### Documentation

Read the [documentation](https://cyberagentailab.github.io/cenreg/) to get started.
