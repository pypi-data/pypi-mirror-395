           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)

              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

# Eolabtools


Eolabtools allows to use various tools for satellite imagery analysis.

# Detection Orientation Culture

## Installation procedure

To install DetectionOrientationCulture, please launch the following commands :

```bash
conda create -n orcult_env python=3.12 libgdal=3.11.0 -c conda-forge -c defaults -y
conda activate orcult_env
pip install eolabtools[DetecOrCult]
```

## Usage

To obtain the crop orientation in a shapefile format, please use the following command. The method implemented uses the fld library from openCV.

```bash
detection_orientation_culture --img path/to/image_file_or_directory
                              --type extension_file_type
                              --rpg path/to/rpg_file.shp \
                              --out_shp path/to/output_file.shp \
                              --out_csv path/to/output_file.csv \
                              --nb_cores 12 \
                              --patch_size 10000 \
                              --slope path/to/slope_file.tif \
                              --aspect path/to/aspect_file.tif
```

- The code relies on the fld algorithm to detect the segments in the images from which the orientations of each of the input RPG
plots are calculated.

- To run the code in parallel, select `--nb_cores`>1.

- If the input image(s) is (are) large, it is advisable to define a --patch_size which will be used to perform patch processing
(faster thanks to parallelization).

- The `--slope` and `--aspect` files must be generated beforehand (see Calculating data used in orientation calculations) and
supplied as input.- ``--osm-config`` : Path to the OSM configuration file with tags to keep in binary raster


# Night OSM Registration

```bash
conda create -n nightosm_env python=3.12 libgdal=3.11.0 markupsafe -c conda-forge
conda activate nightosm_env
pip install eolabtools[NightOsmReg]
```

## Using night_osm_image_registration

Use the command ``night_osm_image_registration`` with the following arguments :

```bash
night_osm_image_registration /path_to_input_files/input_file_1.tif [/path_to_input_files/input_file_2.tif] [...]
                             -o /path_to_output_directory/output_directory/
                             --config /path_to_config_directory/config_file_name
                             --osm-config /path_to_config_directory/osm_config_file_name
```

Arguments are the following :

- ``infile`` : Reference input image to compute shift grid

- ``auxfiles`` : Optional list of additional images to shift based on the same grid

- ``-o``, ``--outdir`` : Output files location

- ``--config`` : Path to the main configuration file

- ``--osm-config`` : Path to the OSM configuration file with tags to keep in binary raster

## Using night_osm_vector_registration

Use the command ``night_osm_vector_registration`` with the following arguments :

```bash
night_osm_vector_registration /path_to_points/points.gpkg
                              /path_to_displacement_grid/displacement_grid.tif
                              -o /path_to_output_directory/output_directory/
                              -n output_file_basename
```


Arguments are the following :

- ``invector`` : Path to the input vector file.

- ``grid`` : Path to the displacement grid (band1 : shift along X in pixels, band 2 : shift along Y in pixels).

- ``-o``, ``--outdir`` : Output directory.

- ``-n``, ``--name`` : Basename for the output file.

# Sun Map Generation

SunMapGeneration generates a map per date with the percentage of sun exposure over the time range, as well as a vector file that
gives the transition times from shade to sun (and sun to shade) for each pixel at the first date.
It takes as inputs a Digital Surface Model (DSM) of the area of interest, a range of dates and a time range per date of your choice.
Shadow masks can also be produced at each step.

*Please note that the time range is given in the local time of the area of interest.*

If the area of interest is important, the DSM should be divided into tiles beforehand (typically 1km*1km). The list of tiles is
given as input. The tool will manage the shadow impact on adjacent tiles.

## Installation procedure


To install SunMapGeneration, please launch the following commands :

```bash
conda create -n sunmap_env python=3.12 libgdal=3.5.0 -c conda-forge -c defaults -y
conda activate sunmap_env
pip install georastertools --no-binary rasterio
pip install eolabtools[SunMapGen] --force-reinstall --no-cache-dir
```

## Usage

To launch SunMapGeneration, please use the following command :

```bash
sun_map_generation --digital_surface_model /path_to_input_files/input_files.lst (or .tif)
                   --date YYYY-MM-DD YYYY-MM-DD 3
                   --time HH:MM HH:MM 30
                   --nb_cores 32
                   --occ_changes 4
                   --output_dir /path_to_output_directory/output_directory/
                   --save_temp
                   --save_masks
```

- ``--digital_surface_model`` : Path to the `.lst` file containing the names of the `.tif` files. When only one input file is necessary for the computation, the name `.tif` file can be given.

- ``--tiles_file`` :

- ``--date`` : Date or date range (YYYY-MM-DD) and step (in days). The step value should be strictly positive and default value is 1 day.

- ``--time`` : Time or time range (HH:MM) and step (in minutes). The step value should be strictly positive and default value is 30 minutes.

- ``--occ_changes`` (should be >= 3) : Limit of sun/shade change of a pixel over one day. Default value 4.

- ``--nb_cores`` : To launch parallel processing. Number of processes to be entered.

- ``--output_dir`` : Path to the output directory.

- ``--save_temp`` : To be filled in to obtain the file describing the calculation time per step in the processing chain (`processing_time.csv`).

- ``--save_masks`` : To save shadow masks calculated at each time step


# Tests

The project comes with a suite functional tests. To run them, 
launch the command ``pytest tests``. To run a specific test, execute ``pytest tests/test_toolname.py::test_name``.
The tests perform comparisons between generated files and reference files. 


# Documentation generation

To generate the documentation, run in an environment that contains `sphinx_rtd_theme` and `sphinxcontrib.bibtex` : 

```bash
sphinx-build -b html docs/source docs/build
```

The documentation is generated using the theme "readthedocs".
