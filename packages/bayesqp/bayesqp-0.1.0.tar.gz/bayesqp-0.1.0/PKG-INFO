# BayeSQP: Bayesian Optimization though Sequential Quadratic Programming

![Overview of the framework of BayeSQP.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brunzema/bayesqp/main/assets/BayeSQP.png)

The repository contains a _plug-and-play_ implementation of BayeSQP (NeurIPS 2025). BayeSQP as a framework aims to combine ideas from both Bayesian optimization (BO) and ideas from sequential quadratic optimization to effectively solve potentially constrained black-box optimization problems.

$$
x^* = \arg\min_{x \in \mathcal{X}} f(x) \quad \text{subject to} \quad c_i(x) \geq 0, \quad \forall i \in \mathbb{I}_m := \{1, \ldots, m\}
$$

With this repository and package, we hope to provide practitioners with an easy-to-use tool that seemlessly integrates with the [BoTorch API](https://botorch.org/).

## Installation

You can install BayeSQP in a few different ways depending on your needs.

### 📦 From PyPI (recommended)

Once the package is published to PyPI (in progess), simply run:

```bash
pip install bayesqp
```

This will install the core dependencies `numpy`, `scipy`, `cvxopt`, `botorch`, `gpytorch`.

### 🧪 From source (development version)

If you want the latest version from the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/brunzema/bayesqp.git
cd bayesqp
pip install .
```

Or, for editable (developer) installation:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

### 💡 Optional dependencies

To run the example notebooks, install the optional dependencies:

```bash
pip install ".[examples]"
```

This will further install `jupyter` and `matplotlib`.

### ✅ Verify your installation

You can verify that BayeSQP is installed correctly with:

```bash
python -c "import bayesqp; print(bayesqp.__version__)"
```

## Getting Started

To build intuition about BayeSQP, both on behavior and configuration, take a look at the example notebooks in the `examples/` folder.
To use BayeSQP in your own project, follow the installation steps mentioned above and then simply:

```python
from bayesqp import BayeSQP

# Define your optimization problem following the BoTorch API
func = MyConstrainedOptimizationProblem()

# Initialize BayeSQP
bayesqp = BayeSQP(objective_function=func)

# Run optimization
result = bayesqp.minimize(x0, max_evals=50)

# Show result
print(result)
```

There are various ways to configure BayeSQP for your specific problem. We provide a set of default parameters that currently yield the best performance on our use cases and with this they hopefully will also provide a good starting point for your problem.

## Formulating the Objective

To make the integration as seamless as possible, we also provide a small wrapper to transfer your objective and constraints formulated in numpy directly into a `ConstrainedBaseTestProblem`.

```python
from bayesqp import NumpyToConstrainedBoTorchProblem

# Define your Numpy functions
def my_objective(x):
    # Minimize: x[0]^2 + x[1]^2
    return np.sum(x**2)

def constraint_c1(x):
    # Constraint: x[0] + x[1] >= 1 
    # -> x[0] + x[1] - 1 >= 0
    return x[0] + x[1] - 1.0

def constraint_c2(x):
    # Constraint: x[0] <= 0.5
    # -> 0.5 - x[0] >= 0
    return 0.5 - x[0]

# Define bounds (e.g., 2D problem between -2 and 2)
bounds = [(-2.0, 2.0), (-2.0, 2.0)]

# Instantiate the wrapper
problem = NumpyToConstrainedBoTorchProblem(
    objective_func=my_objective,
    constraint_funcs=[constraint_c1, constraint_c2],
    bounds=bounds,
    negate=False
)

test_X = torch.tensor([
    [0.0, 0.0],   # Infeasible
    [0.4, 0.8]    # Feasible
], dtype=torch.double)

# Evaluate Objective
obj_vals = problem(test_X)
print(f"Objective Values: {obj_vals}") 
# Output: Objective Values: tensor([0.0000, 0.8000], dtype=torch.float64)

# Evaluate Constraints
constraints = problem.evaluate_slack(test_X)
print(f"Constraint Values: {constraints}")
# Output: Constraint Values: tensor([[-1.0000,  0.5000],
#                                    [ 0.2000,  0.1000]], dtype=torch.float64)

is_feasible = problem.is_feasible(test_X)
print(f"Feasible: {is_feasible}") 
# Output: Feasible: tensor([False,  True])
```

Such a wrapper also exists for torch: `TorchToConstrainedBoTorchProblem`. Here it is however necessary to specify if the functions can handle batches and setting the `vectorized`-flag accordingly.

```python
# cannot handle batches -> vectorized = False
def objective_simple(x):
    return torch.sin(x[0]) * x[1]

# can handle batches -> vectorized = True
def objective_vec(x):
    return torch.sin(x[..., 0]) * x[..., 1]
```
