                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,

              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,

              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only

# *Less Is More, but Where?*<br>Dynamic Token Compression via LLM-Guided Keyframe Prior

This repository is the official PyTorch implementation of [DyToK](https://openreview.net/pdf/b4a33413bf051e6a2476bdf1b3f34a1cab246ff1.pdf).

## 🎯 Motivation

![Unveiling the keyframe prior in VLLMs](assets/motivation.png)
**Unveiling the keyframe prior in VLLMs.** We visualize the averaged attention from the final text token to visual tokens across all layers for each frame. The top-8 frames by attention scores are shown chronologically, with ground truth (GT) keyframes highlighted in red. We observe that *even when the model answers incorrectly, its attention still pinpoints relevant frames, revealing a strong task-dependent keyframe prior.*

## 🌈 Method

![Illustration of DyToK](assets/method.png)
**Illustration of DyToK.** We adaptively compress video tokens through two synergistic components:

1. **Temporal Importance Estimation** leverages cross-modal attention from a lightweight assistant model to identify keyframes;
2. **Dynamic Frame-Level Compression** that proportionally allocates token budgets to preserve salient content.

## 🎉 News

* **[2025.12.06]**  Released code for integrating DyToK with encoder feature-based pruning methods.
* **[2025.09.18]**  Our paper has been accepted at **NeurIPS 2025**.

## 🔥 TODO

- [x] Initialize Project.
- [ ] Release code for integrating DyToK with LLM attention-based pruning methods.
- [ ] Add support for Qwen3-VL.

## 📦 Installation

DyToK's code is extremely concise and works out of the box. Just install and go!

#### 1. Quick Install

Install the latest stable version directly from PyPI:

```bash
pip install dytok
```

#### 2. Development Install

Clone the repository and install in editable mode:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yu-lin-li/DyToK.git
cd DyToK
pip install -e .
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

Integrating DyToK takes just **two lines of code**:

```python
from dytok import visionzip
visionzip(model, dytok=True, use_tiny=True, tiny_model=tiny_model)
```

Try it out with our demo script using LLaVA-OneVision:

```bash
python playground/llavaov_infer.py
```

## 📊 Reproducing Results

All experiments in the paper are based on [LMMs-Eval](https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/lmms-eval). Follow these steps to reproduce our results.

#### 1. Setup Environment

```bash
# Create virtual environment
conda create -n dytok python=3.10
conda activate dytok

# Install base models (e.g., LLaVA-OneVision)
pip install git+https://github.com/LLaVA-VL/LLaVA-NeXT.git

# Install DyToK
git clone https://github.com/yu-lin-li/DyToK.git
cd DyToK
pip install -e .

# Install LMMs-Eval streamlined for DyToK
cd eval
pip install -e .
pip install flash-attn==2.6.3  # optional
```

> 💡 Note: Our `eval/` directory contains a minimal, DyToK-focused version of LMMs-Eval. For full functionality, install the [official LMMs-Eval]((https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/lmms-eval?tab=readme-ov-file#installation)) separately and integrate DyToK as described in [Development](#️-development).

#### 2. Evaluation

Reproduce DyToK-enhanced VisionZip results on LLaVA-OneVision:

```bash
bash eval/scripts/dytok_visionzip_tiny_32_ov.sh
```

## 🛠️ Development

#### 1. Repository Structure

```bash
.
├── assets/
├── dytok/                    # Core DyToK logic
│   └── visionzip/            # DyToK-enhanced VisionZip
├── eval/
│   ├── lmms_eval/            # Evaluation toolkit
│   │   └── models/           # DyToK-integrated models

├── playground/               # Demo inference scripts
│   └── llavaov_infer.py
├── pyproject.toml
└── README.md
```

#### 2. Adapt DyToK to Your Own Method

DyToK is designed as a **plug-and-play module**. To integrate it into your token compression method:

* Look for code blocks explicitly annotated to isolate DyToK-specific logic from the base method, as shown below:

```python
# ! ———— DyToK Begin ————
...
# ! ———— DyToK End ————
```

* Migrate the enclosed logic into your method.

> ✅ Pro Tip: Use the [Better Comments](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=aaron-bond.better-comments) extension in [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to highlight DyToK annotations in red!

#### 3. Integrate with Your Own LMMs-Eval

To add DyToK support to your local LMMs-Eval:

```bash
cp eval/lmms_eval/models/*.py <YOUR_LMMS_EVAL_PATH>/models/
```

Then register the model in `<YOUR_LMMS_EVAL_PATH>/models/__init__.py`:

```python
# Add the DyToK model entry to AVAILABLE_MODELS
AVAILABLE_MODELS = {
    # existing models ...
    "llava_onevision_dytok": "Llava_OneVision_DyToK"
}
```
