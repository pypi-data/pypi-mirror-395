# Inference Configuration for Local Fine-tuned Model
# This config runs inference on a local fine-tuned model checkpoint.
# Use this after training a model with the FAI-RL framework.

  # Dataset Configuration
  # Specifies which dataset to run inference on

  dataset_split: "test"                            # Dataset split to use: train, test, or validation
  dataset_columns: ["persona", "prompt"]           # List of columns to concatenate as model input
  response_column: "response"                      # Name of column to store model responses (default: "response")
  
  # System Prompt
  # Provides context and instructions to the model for generation
  # Multi-line system message that defines the model's behavior and task

  # Generation Parameters
  # Controls the randomness and quality of generated text
  # Tips: For consistent results, use temperature: 0.0 and do_sample: false
  #       For creative generation, use temperature: 0.8-1.2 with top_p: 0.9
  temperature: 1.0            # Sampling temperature (0.0 = deterministic, 2.0 = very random)
  top_p: 0.9                  # Nucleus sampling threshold (0.0-1.0, lower = more focused)
  max_new_tokens: 1000        # Maximum number of tokens to generate per response
  do_sample: true             # Enable sampling (false = greedy decoding, true = stochastic sampling)
