# MMLU Evaluation Configuration for API-based Inference
# This config evaluates a model via API (e.g., OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, hosted LLM) on the MMLU benchmark
# using automatic JSON answer extraction and accuracy calculation.

  # API Configuration
  # For API-based inference, provide both model identifier and API credentials
  api_endpoint: "https://<YOUR_API_ENDPOINT>"  # Custom API endpoint URL for hosted model
  api_key: "<YOUR_API_KEY>"                    # API authentication key (e.g., OpenAI API key)
  model: "meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct"    # API model identifier (format depends on API provider)
  
  # Where to save evaluation results (CSV format with all dataset columns + accuracy)

  # Dataset Configuration
  # Specifies which dataset and subset to evaluate on
  dataset_name: "cais/mmlu"                  # HuggingFace dataset identifier
  dataset_subset: "all"                      # Specific subset of the dataset (optional). Available: 57 subjects (e.g., "abstract_algebra", "college_biology", "high_school_physics"), or "all" for all subjects
  dataset_split: "test"                      # Which split to evaluate on: test, validation, or dev
  dataset_columns: ["question", "choices", "answer"]  # List of dataset columns to include in evaluation
  ground_truth_column: "answer"              # Column containing the correct answers for accuracy calculation
  
  # System Prompt Template
  # Template for evaluation prompts (supports variable substitution with {variable})
  # The model will be prompted with this template for each evaluation sample

  # Generation Parameters
  # Controls how the model generates responses during evaluation
  temperature: 0.0                           # Sampling temperature for response generation (0.0 = deterministic, 2.0 = very random)
  top_p: 0.9                                 # Nucleus sampling parameter - probability threshold for token selection (0.0-1.0, lower = more focused)
  max_new_tokens: 2000                       # Maximum tokens to generate per response
  do_sample: false                           # Whether to use sampling for generation (false = greedy decoding, true = stochastic sampling)
