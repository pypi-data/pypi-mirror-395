# MMLU Evaluation Configuration for Local Fine-tuned Model
# This config evaluates a local fine-tuned model on the MMLU benchmark
# using automatic JSON answer extraction and accuracy calculation.

evaluation:
  # Model Configuration
  # Path to the trained model to evaluate (local checkpoint)
  model: "Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507"
  
  # Where to save evaluation results (CSV format with all dataset columns + accuracy)
  output_file: "outputs/qwen3-4B-inst-vanilla-v1-eval-gsm8k.csv"

  # Dataset Configuration
  # Specifies which dataset and subset to evaluate on
  dataset_name: "openai/gsm8k"                  # HuggingFace dataset identifier
  dataset_subset: "main"                      # Specific subset of the dataset (optional). Available: 57 subjects (e.g., "abstract_algebra", "college_biology", "high_school_physics"), or "all" for all subjects
  dataset_split: "test"                      # Which split to evaluate on: test, validation, or dev
  dataset_columns: ["question", "answer"]  # List of dataset columns to include in evaluation
  ground_truth_column: "answer"              # Column containing the correct answers for accuracy calculation
  response_column: "response"                # Name of column to store/read model responses (default: "response")
  
  # System Prompt Template
  # Template for evaluation prompts (supports variable substitution with {variable})
  # The model will be prompted with this template for each evaluation sample
  system_prompt: |
    Question: {question}

    Let's think step by step.
  
  # Generation Parameters
  # Controls how the model generates responses during evaluation
  temperature: 0.0                           # Sampling temperature for response generation (0.0 = deterministic, 2.0 = very random)
  top_p: 1.0                                 # Nucleus sampling parameter - probability threshold for token selection (0.0-1.0, lower = more focused)
  max_new_tokens: 2000                       # Maximum tokens to generate per response
  do_sample: false                           # Whether to use sampling for generation (false = greedy decoding, true = stochastic sampling)
