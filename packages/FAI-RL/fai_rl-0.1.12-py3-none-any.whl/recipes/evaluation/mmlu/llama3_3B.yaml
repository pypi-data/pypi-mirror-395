    Let's think step by step.
  
  # Generation Parameters
  # Controls how the model generates responses during evaluation
  temperature: 0.0                           # Sampling temperature for response generation (0.0 = deterministic, 2.0 = very random)
  top_p: 0.9                                 # Nucleus sampling parameter - probability threshold for token selection (0.0-1.0, lower = more focused)
  max_new_tokens: 2000                       # Maximum tokens to generate per response
  do_sample: false                           # Whether to use sampling for generation (false = greedy decoding, true = stochastic sampling)
