INSTRUCTIONS = """## General Rules
- All line and column numbers are 1-indexed.
- Always analyze/search context before each file edit.
- This MCP does NOT make permanent file changes. Use other tools for editing.
- Work iteratively: Small steps, intermediate sorries, frequent checks.

## Key Tools
- lean_file_outline: Concise skeleton of a file (imports, docstrings, declarations). Token efficient.
- lean_local_search: Confirm declarations (theorems/lemmas/defs/etc.) exist. VERY USEFUL AND FAST!
- lean_goal: Check proof state. USE OFTEN!
- lean_diagnostic_messages: Understand current proof situation.
- lean_hover_info: Documentation about terms and lean syntax.
- lean_leansearch: Search theorems using natural language or Lean terms.
- lean_loogle: Search definitions and theorems by name, type, or subexpression.
- lean_leanfinder: Semantic search for theorems using Lean Finder.
- lean_state_search: Search theorems using goal-based search.
