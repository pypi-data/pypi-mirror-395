                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or

              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or

           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,

              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# Two Points Interpolation Python

Calculate optimal trajectory (position, velocity, acceleration) between two points with kinematic constraints.

## Overview

This library provides two trajectory planning algorithms:
1. **Constant Acceleration**: Generates smooth trajectories with acceleration limits
2. **Constant Jerk**: Generates even smoother trajectories with jerk (acceleration derivative) limits


## Installation

### From PyPI (when published)

```bash
pip install two-point-interpolation
```

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yuokamoto/two_points_interpolation_py.git
cd two_points_interpolation_py
pip install -e .
```

### For Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yuokamoto/two_points_interpolation_py.git
cd two_points_interpolation_py
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Install pre-commit hooks for automatic code formatting and type checking
pre-commit install
```

The pre-commit hooks will automatically run before each commit to:
- Format code with `autopep8`
- Check types with `mypy` (strict for `constant_acc` module)
- Validate code style with `flake8`
- Remove trailing whitespace
- Validate YAML files

You can also run the hooks manually on all files:
```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

## Quick Start

### Constant Acceleration

```python
from two_point_interpolation import TwoPointInterpolation

# Create interpolator
interp = TwoPointInterpolation()

# Set start, end, and constraints
interp.init(p0=0.0, pe=100.0, acc_max=2.0, vmax=10.0, dec_max=4.0)

# Calculate trajectory
total_time = interp.calc_trajectory()

# Get state at any time
pos, vel, acc = interp.get_point(t=5.0)
```

### Constant Jerk

```python
from two_point_interpolation.constant_jerk import TwoPointInterpolationJerk

interp = TwoPointInterpolationJerk()
interp.init(p0=0.0, pe=100.0, amax=2.0, vmax=10.0, jmax=1.0)

total_time = interp.calc_trajectory()
pos, vel, acc, jerk = interp.get_point(t=5.0)
```

**Note**: Constant jerk implementation is currently under review. See TODO section below.

## Examples

Run example scripts to see visualizations:

```bash
# Basic constant acceleration
python3 examples/example_constant_acc.py

# Constant jerk (smoother)
python3 examples/example_constant_jerk.py
```

## Testing

The library includes a comprehensive YAML-based testing system.

### Quick Start

```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest tests/test_yaml_cases.py -v

# Generate trajectory visualizations
python tests/generate_plots.py

# List available test categories
python tests/generate_plots.py --list
```

## Example Results

### Case 0: vmax not reached
![Case 0](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yuokamoto/two_points_interpolation_py/main/examples/images/acc_constant_0.png)

**Parameters**: `t0=1.0, p0=5, pe=15, acc_max=2.0, dec_max=3.0, vmax=10.0, v0=0, ve=0`

Trajectory when the peak velocity is below vmax. Shows two phases: acceleration and deceleration.

### Case 1: vmax reached
![Case 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yuokamoto/two_points_interpolation_py/main/examples/images/acc_constant_1.png)

**Parameters**: `t0=0, p0=0, pe=50, acc_max=2.0, dec_max=4.0, vmax=8.0, v0=2.0, ve=1.0`

Trajectory when vmax is reached. Shows three phases: acceleration, constant velocity, and deceleration.

## Known Issues & TODO

### Constant Jerk Implementation Issues
The `constant_jerk` module requires significant improvements:

1. **API Contract Violation**: The `ve` (final velocity) parameter is accepted in `init()` but never used in calculations
2. **Debug Output**: `calc_trajectory()` prints debug information to stdout (should use logging or be removed)
3. **Time Boundary Bug**: Case 3 condition uses `4*t1+2*2*t2+t3` instead of correct `4*t1+2*t2+t3`, causing phase transition errors
4. **Missing Tests**: No test coverage for constant jerk functionality
5. **Support acc_max != dec_max**: Extend to support independent acceleration/deceleration limits

### Other
- Add comprehensive test suite for `constant_jerk` module
- Verify mathematical correctness of jerk-based trajectories

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for examples)
