Getting started
===============

Installation
------------

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install cliasi

Quickstart
----------

.. code-block:: python

    from cliasi import cli  # Global Cliasi instance
    import logging

    cli.info("This is an informational message.")
    # > i [CLI] | This is an informational message.
    cli.success("Operation completed successfully!")
    # > ✔ [CLI] | Operation completed successfully!
    cli.messages_stay_in_one_line = True
    # Messages will stay in one line after this
    cli.warn("This is a warning message.")
    # > ! [CLI] | This is a warning message.
    cli.fail("An error occurred!")
    # > X [CLI] | An error occurred!
    # Debug messages are hidden by default as default verbosity level is INFO
    cli.log("This is a debug message (only shown with high verbosity).")
    # > (no output)
    cli.min_verbose_level = logging.DEBUG

messages_stay_in_one_line
--------------------------

When ``messages_stay_in_one_line`` is set to ``True``, all subsequent messages
will overwrite the previous message instead of creating a new line. This is useful for progress updates or status messages.

This is disabled by default so enable it using ``cli.messages_stay_in_one_line = True``. or pass ``Cliasi(prefix="CLI", messages_stay_in_one_line=True)`` when creating a new instance.

Cliasi instances
-----------------
You can also create your own instance to customize its behavior.

This is especially helpful when giving over control to other parts of your application.
The new instance will copy the global verbosity setting when no verbosity is specified.

.. code-block:: python

    # Other part of your application that doesn't know what prefix to use
    from cliasi import Cliasi
    import logging

    # Create a new instance with a custom prefix and higher verbosity
    my_cli = Cliasi(prefix="APP")
    # Verbosity is blank so global setting is used

    my_cli.log_small("This is a debug message from my_cli.")  # Will be shown as global verbosity is DEBUG now
    # > l [APP] | This is a debug message from my_cli.

    # Cliasi will also do line breaks
    my_cli.info("This is an info message from my_cli.\n This is after a line break.")
    # > i [APP] | This is an info message from my_cli.
    # >         | This is after a line break.
