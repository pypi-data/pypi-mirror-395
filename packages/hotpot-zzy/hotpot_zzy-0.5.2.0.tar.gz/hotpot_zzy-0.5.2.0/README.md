## 📖 Introduction

Hotpot is not just a chemical informatics toolkit; it is a **research-grade infrastructure** designed to 
digitize, model, and analyze chemistry environments.

Unlike traditional tools (e.g., RDKit, OpenBabel) that rely heavily on explicit valence rules—which 
often fail in metal-ligand scenarios—Hotpot adopts a **Data-Driven Philosophy**. It seamlessly 
integrates a robust chemical kernel with modern deep learning pipelines, enabling "Fuzzy Modeling" 
for complex chemical intuition that cannot be captured by simple mathematical formulas.

**Crucially, Hotpot abstracts the complexity of Artificial Intelligence into a silent, high-performance backend.**

To the user, Hotpot feels like the familiar tools you already use. It simulates manipulating actual 
chemical entities -- whether a single `Molecule` or a periodic `Crystal` Lattice. You interact solely with 
intuitive `Molecule` and `Crystal` objects—the standard vernacular of chemistry. The massive AI training 
frameworks and complex inference engines run entirely behind the scenes, invisible and automated.

+ **Minimal-AI Code**: Users typically do not need to touch tensors, write training loops, or configure neural networks.
+ **Seamless Adaptation**: For standard tasks, the default models work out of the box. For specific domains, 
you simply organize your private data into Molecule objects; Hotpot ingests the data and refines the 
engine automatically.


## 🏗️ Key Features & Architecture

Hotpot is built on a modular architecture designed to hide complexity. It consists of a robust 
**Chemical Kernel** for data handling and a silent **AI Engine** for intelligence.

### 1. The Chemical Kernel (`hotpot.core`)
*The robust foundation that digitizes chemistry.*

+ **Chemist-Centric Interface**:
  - **Intuitive Operations**: Operates in the natural vernacular of chemistry. You interact with `Molecule`,
    `Atom`, and `Bond` objects directly—manipulating structures in code feels exactly like building models in a lab.
  - Plays nicely with existing cheminformatics tools and workflows, preserving the interfaces users are already used to.
+ **Multi-Scale Property Integration**:
  - **Micro to Macro**: A unified interface for managing diverse physical properties. Effortlessly manage microscopic descriptors
    (`Atom.elements`, `Molecule.descriptors`) alongside macroscopic observables (`Molecule.get_thermo()`).
+ **Universal I/O Bridge**: 
  - **Read/Write Common Formats**: Seamlessly handles standard chemistry formats such as `.mol2`, `.cif`, `.xyz`, and Gaussian `.gjf`.  
  - **AI-Ready Graphs**: Transparently converts structures into graph representations suitable for modern deep learning
    models, without exposing low-level details to the user. 

### 2. Data-Driven Analysis (Pre-trained & Ready)
*Intelligence baked into the `Molecule` object (especially, for Coordination Chemistry).*

+ **Coordination pattern determination**:
  - **`AIModel.cbond`**: Surpasses traditional valence rules by using deep learning to predict 
  coordinate bonds in complex transition metal environments.
+ **3D Structure Initialization** (`complexes_build_optimize_`):
  - **AI-refined 3D build**: A specialized pipeline for generating metal complexes with AI assisting
  - **Topology-aware optimization**: Adds continuous topological inspection during geometry optimization 
  and applies tailored breaking / reconstruction strategies, preventing common failures in metal complex 
  3D generation, such as tangled chain, interlocked rings, and other non-optimizable artifacts.
+ **Connecting microscopic models with macroscopic observables**:
  - Macroscopic properties (`logβ`, `logD`, ...) are typically statistical constructs emerging from ensembles of microscopic 
  states, rather than from any single configuration. Relying on a small number of static microscopic 
  models to infer macroscopic behavior can therefore introduce substantial bias and be misleading.
  - Hotpot combines approximate microscopic models with rich molecular representations and environmental
  variables to make this micro–macro connection more reliable. Embracing the idea that “all models are wrong, 
  but some are useful”, Hotpot uses AI-based fuzzy modeling to improve the robustness and accuracy of inferring
  macroscopic observables from microscopic model.
+ **Oxidation state identification** - *coming soon ...*
+ **Other important chemical problems**  
  - If there is a core chemistry task you think should be “built-in” to the `Molecule` object, feel free to open an issue and describe your use case.

### 3. Assembly & Generation of Virtual Molecules
*From fragment-based enumeration to AI-driven molecular design.*

+ **High-throughput fragment-based assembly**  
  - Assemble virtual molecules from scaffolds and fragments at scale, enabling grid-like exploration of targeted
  chemical spaces (e.g. focused libraries around a given scaffold or motif).

+ **AI-based molecular generation**  
  - **Molecular generation**: Generate new candidate molecules by learning from a small set of example structures, 
  proposing novel analogues in the same “chemical family” or design space.
  - **Conditional molecular generation**: Generate molecules under explicit goals or constraints — e.g. guided by
  target properties, property predictors, or user-defined objective functions — to search for structures that optimize
  (maximize / minimize) desired performance while respecting structural patterns of the examples.

### 4. Optimization of Wet Experiments
*Close the loop between computation and lab experiments.*

+ **Multiple optimization strategies**  
  - Supports a range of optimization backends, including Bayesian optimization (BO) and evolutionary algorithms (EA), 
  for efficient exploration of experimental parameter spaces.

+ **Structure-aware experimental optimization**  
  - Combines experimental parameters with optional structural / molecular representations, enabling joint optimization
  over both reaction conditions and molecular features.

+ **Mixed-type design spaces**  
  - Handles continuous and discrete variables in a unified framework, suitable for real experimental design problems
  (temperatures, pH, solvents, ligands, catalysts, etc.).

+ **Manifold / parameter-space visualization**  
  - Provides visualization of the explored parameter manifold and optimization trajectory to help chemists understand
  where the optimizer is searching and why.

+ **CLI integration**
  - Exposed via a simple command-line interface, e.g. `hotpot optimize ...`, so optimization workflows can be scripted
  and automated without additional boilerplate.

## 📌 Usage examples
### 1.Building a metal-ligand pair
```python
import hotpot as hp
smi = 'O=C(N(C)CCC)C(C=C1)=NC2=C1C=CC3=C2N=C(C4=NC(C(C)(C)CCC5(C)C)=C5N=N4)C=C3'  # (CyMe4)Pyz-PrMe-DIPhen extractant
ligand = hp.read_mol(smi)

pair = ligand.auto_pair_metal('Eu')
print(pair.smiles)
```

Generate 3D coordinates using `complexes_build_optimize_` method
```pycon
print(pair.coordinates)
pair.complexes_build_optimize_()
print(pair.coordinates)
pair.write('./Eu-pair.mol2')
```
The [mol2 file](https://github.com/Zhang-Zhiyuan-zzy/hotpot/tree/main/doc/mol_file/Eu-pair.mol2) 
and [movie](https://github.com/Zhang-Zhiyuan-zzy/hotpot/tree/main/doc/picture/Eu-pair.gif) after coordination generation.

Both the formation of coordination bond and the generation of 3D structure are driven by **AI model**, 
rather than heuristic rules or pure force fields.

### 2.Cheminformatics support
The `Molecule` object is designed to be a familiar, standard cheminformatics tool for chemists.
You can access the `Atom`, `Bond`, `Rings`, and fragment `Molecule` objects directly through
the *properties* of `Molecule`.

Continuing with the *Eu-ligand pair* example:
```pycon
print(pair.atoms)
print(pair.bonds)
print(pair.rings)                       # all rings
print(pair.ligand_rings)                # rings in ligand

assert len(pair.components) == 1
pair.hide_metal_ligand_bonds()          # Hide the coordination bonds temporarily
assert len(pair.components) == 2        # Now appears as two fragments: [ligand, metal]
pair.recover_hided_metal_ligand_bonds()
assert len(pair.components) == 1        # Restored to a whole pair

eu_metal = pair.metals[0]
print(eu_metal.neighbours)              # [Atom(N), Atom(N), Atom(N), Atom(O)]

print(pair.link_matrix)                 # Connectivity graph table
```

Searching for coordination centers using SMARTS patterns:
```pycon
hits = pair.search_substructure('[Ln](n)(n)(n)O')  # [Ln] --> lanthanide
print(len(hits))  # == 1
print(hits[0].atoms)  # [Atom(N32), Atom(O0), Atom(Eu67), Atom(N10), Atom(N17)]

hits = pair.search_substructure('[Ln](n)(n)O')
print(len(hits))  # == 3

hits = pair.search_substructure('[An](n)(n)(n)O')  # [An] --> actinide
print(len(hits))  # == 0
```

Interfacing with other cheminformatics tools:
```pycon
obMol = pair.to_obmol()
rdMol = pair.to_rdmol()
```
Converting to [PyG (PyTorch Geometric)](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/torch_geometric.data.Data.html#torch_geometric.data.Data) Data:
```pycon
data = pair.to_pyg_data()
print(data.x)                       # Tensor of atom attributes
print(data.x_names)                 # atom attribute name
print(data.edge_index)
print(data.edge_attr)
print(data.edge_attr_names)
print(data.pair_index)              # atom pairs indices
print(data.pair_attr)               # pair attrs
print(data.pair_attr_names)
print(data.rings_node_index)
print(data.rings_attr)              # Tensor with shape [rings_num, 2]
print(data.rings_attr_names)        # ['is_aromatic', 'has_metal']
print(data.rings_node_nums)         # How many atoms in a ring
print(data.mol_rings_node_nums)     # How many rings in the molecule
print(data.coordinates)
```

See the [cheminfo.core API Documentation](./doc/cheminfo.md) for more details.

### 3.Molecular properties, descriptors, and representation
Extracting thermodynamic properties using [`thermo`](https://thermo.readthedocs.io/) library:
```pycon
import hotpot as hp
mol = hp.read_mol('c1ccc(O)cc1', 'smi')  # read a phenol by SMILES
thermo = mol.get_thermo(temp=298.15, pressure=101325)
print(thermo.Tc)  # the critical temperature (K)
print(thermo.Psat)  # the saturation vapor pressure 
print(...)
```
Extracting the Graph-Spectral representation:
```python
import hotpot as hp
mol1 = hp.read_mol('c1ccc(O)cc1', 'smi')
mol2 = hp.read_mol('c1ccccc1C(=O)O', 'smi')
mol1_ = hp.read_mol('c1ccccc1O', 'smi')     # Same molecule, different atom ordering

spectral1 = mol1.graph_spectral()
spectral2 = mol2.graph_spectral()
spectral1_ = mol1_.graph_spectral()

similarity_diff = spectral1 | spectral2
print(similarity_diff)                      # Similarity in graph spectrum: 0.907590226292854
similarity_same = spectral1 | spectral1_
print(similarity_same)                      # Similarity in graph spectrum: 1.0

print(spectral1.vectors.shape)              # numpy array: shape=[6, 13]
print(spectral2.vectors.shape)              # numpy array: shape=[6, 15]
```

### 4.Molecular assembly
The molecular assembly is handled by the standalone module 
[`hotpot.MolAssembly`](./hotpot/cheminfo/mol_assemble/README.md) temporarily.
### Generic description
The molecular assembly (`hotpot.cheminfo.mol_assemble`) module iteratively generates virtual 
molecular structures based on the user-specified molecular Framework (`hotpot.Molecule`) and
assembly fragments `hotpot.cheminfo.mol_assemble.Fragment`. The Framework is a standard 
`Molecule` object, while the assembly operation is specifically implemented using the `Fragment`. 

An instantiated `Fragment` must specify the following four factors:
1) The 2D molecular structure of the fragment (a `Molecule` object)
2) The atom(s) (specified by index) on the fragment used for connection with the Framework
3) The searcher for locating connection sites on the Framework (a `hotpot.cheminfo.search.Searcher` object)
4) The specific connection operation (specified in an `action_func` function) between the `Fragment` and 
the Framework at the connection sites.

The `Fragment` provides users the flexibility to customize their own assembly strategies. 
Of course, `Hotpot` has predefined some common molecular assembly `Fragment` (named `Assembler`).
When handling the `Assembler`, users only need to specify its fragment structure and indicate the
(optional) `action_points` indices (i.e., specify which Fragmental atoms as the `"reaction site"` to
react with the frame `Molecule`).

So far, the predefined `Assembler` include (see the following `Scheme 1` for details):
1) EdgeShoulder (required two `action_points`)
2) AtomLink (required one `action_points`)
3) BondAdding (No `action_points` required)
4) AtomReplace (No `action_points` required)
5) AlkylGraft (No `action_points` required, just a specific `AtomLink`)
6) RingWedge (required one `action_points`)

### 5.Wet-lab experimental optimization

**Hotpot** also integrates a module for optimizing the *wet-lab experiments* using an active learning scheme.
For pure parameter optimization, you can use the CLI interface:
```bash
hotpot optimize [input_excel] [output_dir] --flags args ...
hotpot optimize --help  # for help
```
Simply follow the instructions in the command‑line interface to obtain the optimized recommended parameters.
The results and the manifold visualization of the explored parameter space are saved in `output_dir`.
The `input_excel` file should be organized as follows:

| feature1 | feature2 | ... | featureN | target |
|----------|----------|-----|----------|--------|
| 0.64654  | 148.792  | ... | -30.897  | 0.3433 |
| ...      | ...      | ... | ...      | ...    |
---------------------------------------------------

For optimization involving molecule structures:
```python
import numpy as np
import hotpot as hp

list_smi = [
    'c1cccc1',
    'c1cccc1C(=O)O',
    # ...
]

mol_space = [hp.read_mol(smi) for smi in list_smi]
samples = [
    hp.read_mol(list_smi[i]) for i in np.random.randint(2, size=100).tolist()
]
for mol, params in zip(samples, np.random.randn(100, 3)):
    mol.add_envs(params, name=['T', 'P', 'Conc.'])

bundle = hp.MolBundle(samples)

result = bundle.optimize(
    mol_space=mol_space,  # Optional
    env_space=...,        # Optional
    maximize=True,        # Default
    n_trails=20,
    batch_size=5,
    mol_repr='ComplexFormer_nano',  # Optional[rdkit, fp, spectrum], The optimize method automatically selects a suitable representation.
    visualize=True
)

print(result.mol.smiles)
print(result.env)
result.fig.show()  # Displays the manifold visualization
```


## 🛤️ Roadmap & Project Evolution

Hotpot initially started as a more Pythonic wrapper around OpenBabel and RDKit, aiming to:

- provide a cleaner, chemist-friendly interface on the Python side, and  
- avoid low-level C++ issues (e.g., segmentation faults / exit code 139) ..., and the unnatural modeling of metal complexes.

During development, it became clear that heuristic, rule-based logic is not sufficient for many real chemical problems,
especially in coordination chemistry. Many chemical and biological insights are empirical and resist explicit coding.

Hotpot is therefore evolving from a **rule-based wrapper** into a **data-driven infrastructure** that tries to capture
such *tacit knowledge* through large-scale pre-training on coordination chemistry and related databases.

**Current Status**

- The current `main` branch focuses on a stable, chemist-centric core (`hotpot.cheminfo.core`) and classical utilities.
- Several advanced AI-backed components described in this README currently live in  research branches and
  internal prototypes, and will be merged step by step.
- Public APIs in `hotpot.cheminfo.core` will be kept as stable as possible to ensure backward compatibility as new 
  models and pipelines are integrated.

**Planned Timeline**

A large part of the AI backend is closely tied to ongoing Ph.D. research work.  
Major model components and pipelines are planned to be merged into the public repository progressively as the
research is completed and stabilized (target: around late 2026).
