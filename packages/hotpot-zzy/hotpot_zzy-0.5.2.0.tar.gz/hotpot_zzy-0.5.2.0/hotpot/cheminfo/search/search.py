class Query:
    """
    Query serves as an abstract base class for defining query objects to perform attribute-based
    matching against other objects. Each derived class must implement the abstract `label` property
    and specify `_match_class` to define a compatible class for the `match` method's comparison.

    Query objects are instantiated with keyword arguments representing constraints on attributes,
    stored in the `kwargs` dictionary. These constraints are verified for proper types. The `match`
    method compares the Query instance against a compatible object to check if all constraints
    are satisfied based on their attributes.

    Attributes:
        kwargs (Dict[str, Set[Any]]): A mapping of attribute names to sets of acceptable values.
        _match_class (Type): Specifies the class with which this Query instance can perform
            attribute-based comparison.

    Methods:
        label: Abstract property, to be implemented by derived classes.
        match: Determines whether the given object meets all constraints defined in the Query instance.
        _check_kwargs_types: Ensures that all constraints in kwargs are valid containers, converting
            them to sets if necessary.

    Args:
        kwargs (Dict[str, Union[Container, Any]]): Keyword arguments representing constraints on
            attributes. Keys are attribute names, and values are containers of acceptable values.
