              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:

                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

# PPC - Prot Pipeline Creator

**PPC - Prot Pipeline Creator** is a Python-based tool designed for the bioinformatics processing and analysis of protein data. 

The system is engineered to ingest `.tsv` files from UniProt (UniProtKB), enabling the creation of automated analysis pipelines for filtering, clustering, and generating sub-datasets based on taxonomy (Super Kingdoms), enzymatic activity (EC numbers) and others.    

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need:

-   **Python 3.8+**
    
-   **Pandas**
    

## 🚀 Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    
    Bash
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/emanuelumbelino/prot-pipeline-creator.git
    cd prot-pipeline-creator
    ```
    
2.  Install dependencies (using a virtual environment is recommended):
    
    Bash
    
    ```bash
    pip install pandas
    ```
    

## 💻 Usage

The project uses the concept of "Pipelines" to execute analyses. You can create your own script or use the templates in the `example/` folder.

### Basic Example

To run the default example included in the project, ensure you have a UniProt data file in the correct format and run:

Bash

```bash
python main.py data/file/path.tsv
```

### Creating a Custom Pipeline

You can use the `PPC_Dataframe` class directly in your Python scripts:

```py
from ppc.protein_dataframe import PPC_Dataframe
from ppc.helpers.printer_helper import PPC_Printer

# 1. Load the DataFrame
file_path = 'path/to/your/uniprot_file.tsv'
df = PPC_Dataframe(file_path)

# 2. Use the filters
bacterias_with_pdb = df.bacteria.has_pdb

# 3. Save all proteins filtered in a .tsv file
bacterias_with_pdb.to_tsv('output/my_analysis.tsv')

# 4. Use the Printer helper to print by ec class
PPC_Printer.print_by_ec_class(bacterias_with_pdb)
```

For a comprehensive list of currently implemented filters, please consult the **Wiki**. It is also possible to create new filters by following the existing ones. 

If you have improvements or suggestions, feel free to submit a **Pull Request** or open an **Issue**.

## 🔬 Available Pipelines

The project already includes three example pipelines in the `example/` folder:

1.  **KingdomPipeline**:
    
    -   Splits the original dataset into 4 `.tsv` files based on Super Kingdoms (Archaea, Bacteria, Eukaryota, Viruses).
        
    -   Generates statistics on sequence and enzyme counts per kingdom.
        
2.  **EnzymesPipeline**:
    
    -   Classifies and separates proteins into the 7 main enzyme classes (EC 1 to EC 7).
        
    -   Generates individual files for each class (e.g., `1_oxidoreductases.tsv`, `2_transferases.tsv`).
        
3.  **AnalogousPipeline**:
    
    -   Focuses on the analysis of **HISE** (Homologous Enzymes) and **NISE** (Non-Homologous/Analogous Enzymes).
        
    -   Clusters enzymes that share the same EC number, verifying if they belong to the same Superfamily or different ones.
        
    -   Filters datasets to contain only enzymes with complete EC numbers and PDB annotation.
