""" MotilA example script for batch-processing
===============================================

This script demonstrates how to use the **MotilA** pipeline for batch-processing multiple 
4D/5D image stacks of microglia motility across multiple experimental conditions.

## Overview
- Scans and processes multiple registered 4D TIFF image stacks from multiple experimental folders.
- Applies preprocessing steps such as projection, registration, and spectral unmixing.
- Performs image enhancements like histogram equalization and filtering.
- Segments microglia, applies thresholding, and quantifies motility.
- Collects results from all processed stacks into summary tables for cohort analysis.

## Workflow
1. **Batch Processing**
   - Iterates over multiple subject folders (`ID_list`) and searches for experiment folders (`project_tag`).
   - Processes microglial motility for each dataset according to predefined settings.
   - Saves analysis results per subject in a structured output folder.

2. **Batch Collection**
   - Gathers and combines results across all processed datasets.
   - Saves consolidated results into a cohort-level output directory.

## Usage
- **Modify Parameters:** Adjust paths, projection settings, thresholding methods, and filter settings.
- **Run the Script:** Execute the script to batch process and collect results.
- **Check Outputs:** Processed images, histograms, and motility metrics are saved in structured folders.

## Dependencies
- Requires **MotilA** to be installed and accessible. Please refer to the 
[MotilA GitHub repository](https://github.com/FabrizioMusacchio/MotilA#installation) 
or the [MotilA documentation](https://motila.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html#installation) 
for installation instructions.

## Notes
- The `metadata.xls` file (if present) overrides user-defined parameters during batch processing.
- To clear existing results before running, set `clear_previous_results = True`.
- The pipeline supports **single-channel** and **two-channel** data.
- Ensure `motility_folder` is correctly set for batch result collection.
