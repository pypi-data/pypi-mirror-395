""" MotilA example script for a single file run
===============================================

This script demonstrates how to use the **MotilA** pipeline for analyzing microglial fine process motility 
in 4D/5D image stacks.

## Overview
- Loads and processes a registered 4D TIFF image stack.
- Applies preprocessing steps such as projection, registration, and spectral unmixing.
- Performs image enhancements like histogram equalization and filtering.
- Segments microglia, applies thresholding, and quantifies motility.
- Saves the results, including segmented images, histograms, and motility metrics.

## Usage
1. **Set Parameters**  
   Modify the configuration parameters in the **"DEFINE MOTILA PARAMETERS"** section to fit your dataset.

2. **Run the Script**  
   Execute the script to process the image stack and generate results.

3. **Output**  
   Processed images, histograms, and analysis results are saved in the specified output folder.

## Dependencies
- Requires **MotilA** to be installed and accessible. Please refer to the 
[MotilA GitHub repository](https://github.com/FabrizioMusacchio/MotilA#installation) 
or the [MotilA documentation](https://motila.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html#installation) 
for installation instructions.

## Notes
- The `metadata.xls` file (if present) will override some user-defined parameters (e.g., projection settings) ONLY during batch processing.
- To clear existing results before running, set `clear_previous_results = True`.
- The pipeline supports both **single-channel** and **two-channel** data.
