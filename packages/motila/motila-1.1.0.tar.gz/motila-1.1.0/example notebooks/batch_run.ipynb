    "# MotilA Advanced Batch Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "This script demonstrates how to use the **MotilA** pipeline for batch analyzing microglial fine process motility in 4D/5D image stacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "- Scans and processes multiple registered 4D TIFF image stacks from multiple experimental folders.\n",
    "- Applies preprocessing steps such as projection, registration, and spectral unmixing.\n",
    "- Performs image enhancements like histogram equalization and filtering.\n",
    "- Segments microglia, applies thresholding, and quantifies motility.\n",
    "- Collects results from all processed stacks into summary tables for cohort analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Workflow\n",
    "1. **Batch processing**\n",
    "   - Iterates over multiple subject folders (`ID_list`) and searches for experiment folders (`project_tag`).\n",
    "   - Processes microglial motility for each dataset according to predefined settings.\n",
    "   - Saves analysis results per subject in a structured output folder.\n",
    "2. **Batch collection**\n",
    "   - Gathers and combines results across all processed datasets.\n",
    "   - Saves consolidated results into a cohort-level output directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Usage\n",
    "- **Modify parameters:** Adjust paths, projection settings, thresholding methods, and filter settings.\n",
    "- **Run the script:** Execute the script to batch process and collect results.\n",
    "- **Check outputs:** Processed images, histograms, and motility metrics are saved in structured folders for further analysis and parameter tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dependencies\n",
    "- Requires **MotilA** to be installed and accessible. Please refer to the [MotilA GitHub repository](https://github.com/FabrizioMusacchio/MotilA#installation) or the [MotilA documentation](https://motila.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html#installation) for installation instructions.\n",
