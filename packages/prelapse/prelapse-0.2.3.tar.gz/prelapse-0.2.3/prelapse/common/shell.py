ffconcat requires all input images in a group to have matching pixel formats,
including chroma subsampling (e.g., YCbCr4:2:0 vs YCbCr4:4:4).
Inconsistent formats cause ffplay to repeatedly log errors and consume CPU,
leading to a potential hang.

To resolve:

1. Identify the problematic group at the timestamp above.

2. Inspect image metadata using e.g. exiftool on Linux:
     exiftool "image.jpg"
   Look for the line:
     Y Cb Cr Sub Sampling

   Common values include:
     - YCbCr4:4:4 (1 1)
     - YCbCr4:2:0 (2 2)

3. Normalize pixel formats:
   a. Modify files in-place:
        {1}mogrify -sampling-factor 4:2:0 "image.jpg"
   b. Or, to preserve originals:
        mkdir resampled
        {1}mogrify -path resampled -sampling-factor 4:2:0 "image.jpg"

   Then update the group's path to include "/resampled".


See this link for information about chroma subsampling:
  https://matthews.sites.wfu.edu/misc/jpg_vs_gif/JpgCompTest/JpgChromaSub.html

Aborting to prevent repeated error spam and excessive CPU usage.
