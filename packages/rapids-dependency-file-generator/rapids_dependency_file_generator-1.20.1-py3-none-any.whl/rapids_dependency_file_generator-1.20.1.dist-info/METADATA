              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions

              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable

           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or

                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# rapids-dependency-file-generator

`rapids-dependency-file-generator` is a Python CLI tool that generates conda `environment.yaml` files and `requirements.txt` files from a single YAML file, typically named `dependencies.yaml`.

When installed, it makes the `rapids-dependency-file-generator` CLI command available which is responsible for parsing a `dependencies.yaml` configuration file and generating the appropriate conda `environment.yaml` and `requirements.txt` dependency files.

## Installation

`rapids-dependency-file-generator` is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/rapids-dependency-file-generator/). To install, run:

```sh
pip install rapids-dependency-file-generator
```

## Usage

When `rapids-dependency-file-generator` is invoked, it will read a `dependencies.yaml` file from the current directory and generate children dependency files.

The `dependencies.yaml` file has the following characteristics:

- it is intended to be committed to the root directory of repositories
- it can define matrices that enable the output dependency files to vary according to any arbitrary specification (or combination of specifications), including CUDA version, machine architecture, Python version, etc.
- it contains bifurcated lists of dependencies based on the dependency's purpose (i.e. build, runtime, test, etc.). The bifurcated dependency lists are merged according to the description in the _"How Dependency Lists Are Merged"_ section below.

## `dependencies.yaml` Format

The `dependencies.yaml` file has three relevant top-level keys: `files`, `channels`, and `dependencies`. These keys are described in detail below.

### `files` Key

The top-level `files` key is responsible for determining the following:

- which types of dependency files should be generated (i.e. conda `environment.yaml` files and/or `requirements.txt` files)
- where the generated files should be written to (relative to the `dependencies.yaml` file)
- which variant files should be generated (based on the provided matrix)
- which of the dependency lists from the top-level `dependencies` key should be included in the generated files

Here is an example of what the `files` key might look like:

```yaml
files:
  all: # used as the prefix for the generated dependency file names for conda or requirements files (has no effect on pyproject.toml files)
    output: [conda, requirements] # which dependency file types to generate. required, can be "conda", "requirements", "pyproject", "none" or a list of non-"none" values
    conda_dir: conda/environments # where to put conda environment.yaml files. optional, defaults to "conda/environments"
    requirements_dir: python/cudf # where to put requirements.txt files. optional, but recommended. defaults to "python"
    pyproject_dir: python/cudf # where to put pyproject.toml files. optional, but recommended. defaults to "python"
    matrix: # (optional) contains an arbitrary set of key/value pairs to determine which dependency files that should be generated. These values are included in the output filename.
      cuda: ["11.5", "11.6"] # which CUDA version variant files to generate.
      arch: [x86_64] # which architecture version variant files to generate. This value should be the result of running the `arch` command on a given machine.
    includes: # a list of keys from the `dependencies` section which should be included in the generated files
      - build
      - test
      - runtime
  build: # multiple `files` children keys can be specified
    output: requirements
    conda_dir: conda/environments
    requirements_dir: python/cudf
    matrix:
      cuda: ["11.5"]
      arch: [x86_64]
      py: ["3.8"]
    includes:
      - build
```

The result of the above configuration is that the following dependency files would be generated:

- `conda/environments/all_cuda-115_arch-x86_64.yaml`
- `conda/environments/all_cuda-116_arch-x86_64.yaml`
- `python/cudf/requirements_all_cuda-115_arch-x86_64.txt`
- `python/cudf/requirements_all_cuda-116_arch-x86_64.txt`
- `python/cudf/requirements_build_cuda-115_arch-x86_64_py-38.txt`

The `all*.yaml` and `requirements_all*.txt` files would include the contents of the `build`, `test`, and `runtime` dependency lists from the top-level `dependency` key. The `requirements_build*.txt` file would only include the contents of the `build` dependency list from the top-level `dependency` key.

The value of `output` can also be `none` as shown below.

```yaml
files:
  test:
    output: none
    includes:
      - test
```

When `output: none` is used, the `conda_dir`, `requirements_dir` and `matrix` keys can be omitted. The use case for `output: none` is described in the [_Additional CLI Notes_](#additional-cli-notes) section below.

#### `extras`

A given file may include an `extras` entry that may be used to provide inputs specific to a particular file type

Here is an example:

```yaml
files:
  build:
    output: pyproject
    includes: # a list of keys from the `dependencies` section which should be included in the generated files
      - build
    extras:
      table: table_name
      key: key_name
```

Currently the supported extras by file type are:
- pyproject.toml
  - table: The table in pyproject.toml where the dependencies should be written. Acceptable values are "build-system", "project", and "project.optional-dependencies".
  - key: The key corresponding to the dependency list in `table`. This may only be provided for the "project.optional-dependencies" table since the key name is fixed for "build-system" ("requires") and "project" ("dependencies"). Note that this implicitly prohibits including optional dependencies via an inline table under the "project" table.

### `channels` Key

The top-level `channels` key specifies the channels that should be included in any generated conda `environment.yaml` files.

It might look like this:

```yaml
channels:
  - rapidsai
  - conda-forge
```

In the absence of a `channels` key, some sensible defaults for RAPIDS will be used (see [constants.py](./src/rapids_dependency_file_generator/constants.py)).

### `dependencies` Key

The top-level `dependencies` key is where the bifurcated dependency lists should be specified.

Underneath the `dependencies` key are sets of key-value pairs. For each pair, the key can be arbitrarily named, but should match an item from the `includes` list of any `files` entry.

The value of each key-value pair can have the following children keys:

- `common` - contains dependency lists that are the same across all matrix variations
- `specific` - contains dependency lists that are specific to a particular matrix combination

The values of each of these keys are described in detail below.

#### `common` Key

The `common` key contains a list of objects with the following keys:

- `output_types` - a list of output types (e.g. "conda" for `environment.yaml` files or "requirements" for `requirements.txt` files) for the packages in the `packages` key
- `packages` - a list of packages to be included in the generated output file

#### `specific` Key

The `specific` key contains a list of objects with the following keys:

- `output_types` - _same as `output_types` for the `common` key above_
- `matrices` - a list of objects (described below) which define packages that are specific to a particular matrix combination

##### `matrices` Key

Each list item under the `matrices` key contains a `matrix` key and a `packages` key.
The `matrix` key is used to define which matrix combinations from `files.[*].matrix` will use the associated packages.
The `packages` key is a list of packages to be included in the generated output file for a matching matrix.
This is elaborated on in [How Dependency Lists Are Merged](#how-dependency-lists-are-merged).

An example of the above structure is exemplified below:

```yaml
dependencies:
  build: # dependency list name
    common: # dependencies common among all matrix variations
      - output_types: [conda, requirements] # the output types this list item should apply to
        packages:
          - common_build_dep
      - output_types: conda
        packages:
          - cupy
          - pip: # supports `pip` key for conda environment.yaml files
              - some_random_dep
    specific: # dependencies specific to a particular matrix combination
      - output_types: conda # dependencies specific to conda environment.yaml files
        matrices:
          - matrix:
              cuda: "11.5"
            packages:
              - cudatoolkit=11.5
          - matrix:
              cuda: "11.6"
            packages:
              - cudatoolkit=11.6
          - matrix: # an empty matrix entry serves as a fallback if there are no other matrix matches
            packages:
              - cudatoolkit
      - output_types: [conda, requirements]
        matrices:
          - matrix: # dependencies specific to x86_64 and 11.5
              cuda: "11.5"
              arch: x86_64
            packages:
              - a_random_x86_115_specific_dep
          - matrix: # an empty matrix/package entry to prevent error from being thrown for non 11.5 and x86_64 matches
            packages:
      - output_types: requirements # dependencies specific to requirements.txt files
        matrices:
          - matrix:
              cuda: "11.5"
            packages:
              - another_random_dep=11.5.0
          - matrix:
              cuda: "11.6"
            packages:
              - another_random_dep=11.6.0
  test:
    common:
      - output_types: [conda, requirements]
        packages:
          - pytest
```

## How Dependency Lists Are Merged

The information from the top-level `files` and `dependencies` keys are used to determine which dependencies should be included in the final output of the generated dependency files.

Consider the following top-level `files` key configuration:

```yaml
files:
  all:
    output: conda
    conda_dir: conda/environments
    requirements_dir: python/cudf
    matrix:
      cuda: ["11.5", "11.6"]
      arch: [x86_64]
    includes:
      - build
      - test
```

In this example, `rapids-dependency-file-generator` will generate two conda environment files: `conda/environments/all_cuda-115_arch-x86_64.yaml` and `conda/environments/all_cuda-116_arch-x86_64.yaml`.

Since the `output` value is `conda`, `rapids-dependency-file-generator` will iterate through any `dependencies.build.common` and `dependencies.test.common` list entries and use the `packages` of any entry whose `output_types` key is `conda` or `[conda, ...]`.

Further, for the `11.5` and `x86_64` matrix combination, any `build.specific` and `test.specific` list items whose output includes `conda` and whose `matrices` list items matches any of the definitions below would also be merged:

```yaml
specific:
  - output_types: conda
    matrices:
      - matrix:
          cuda: "11.5"
        packages:
          - some_dep1
          - some_dep2
# or
specific:
  - output_types: conda
    matrices:
      - matrix:
          cuda: "11.5"
          arch: "x86_64"
        packages:
          - some_dep1
          - some_dep2
# or
specific:
  - output_types: conda
    matrices:
      - matrix:
          arch: "x86_64"
        packages:
          - some_dep1
          - some_dep2
```

Every `matrices` list must have a match for a given input matrix (only the first matching matrix in the list of `matrices` will be used).
If no matches are found for a particular matrix combination, an error will be thrown.
In instances where an error should not be thrown, an empty `matrix` and `packages` list item can be used:

```yaml
- output_types: conda
  matrices:
    - matrix:
        cuda: "11.5"
        arch: x86_64
        py: "3.8"
      packages:
        - a_very_specific_115_x86_38_dep
    - matrix: # an empty matrix entry serves as a fallback if there are no other matrix matches
      packages:
```

Merged dependency lists are sorted and deduped.

## Additional CLI Notes

Invoking `rapids-dependency-file-generator` without any arguments is meant to be the default behavior for RAPIDS developers. It will generate all of the necessary dependency files as specified in the top-level `files` configuration.

However, there are CLI arguments that can augment the `files` configuration values before the files are generated.

Consider the example when `output: none` is used:

```yaml
files:
  test:
    output: none
    includes:
      - test
```

The `test` file generated by the configuration above is useful for CI, but it might not make sense to necessarily commit those files to a repository. In such a scenario, the following CLI arguments can be used:

```sh
ENV_NAME="cudf_test"

rapids-dependency-file-generator \
  --file-key "test" \
  --output "conda" \
  --matrix "cuda=12.5;arch=$(arch)" > env.yaml
mamba env create --file env.yaml
mamba activate "$ENV_NAME"

# install cudf packages built in CI and test them in newly created environment...
```

The `--file-key` argument is passed the `test` key name from the `files` configuration. Additional flags are used to generate a single dependency file. When the CLI is used in this fashion, it will print to `stdout` instead of writing the resulting contents to the filesystem.

The `--file-key`, `--output`, and `--matrix` flags must be used together. `--matrix` may be an empty string if the file that should be generated does not depend on any specific matrix variations.

Where multiple values for the same key are passed to `--matrix`, e.g. `cuda_suffixed=true;cuda_suffixed=false`, only the last value will be used.

Where `--file-key` is supplied multiple times in the same invocation, the output printed to `stdout` will contain a union (without duplicates) of all of the corresponding dependencies. For example:

```shell
rapids-dependency-file-generator \
  --file-key "test" \
  --file-key "test_notebooks" \
  --output "conda" \
  --matrix "cuda=12.5;arch=$(arch)" > env.yaml
```

The `--prepend-channel` argument accepts additional channels to use, like `rapids-dependency-file-generator --prepend-channel my_channel --prepend-channel my_other_channel`.
If both `--output` and `--prepend-channel` are provided, the output format must be conda.
Prepending channels can be useful for adding local channels with packages to be tested in CI workflows.

Running `rapids-dependency-file-generator -h` will show the most up-to-date CLI arguments.
