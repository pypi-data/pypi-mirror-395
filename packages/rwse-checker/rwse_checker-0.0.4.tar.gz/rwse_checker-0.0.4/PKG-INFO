# rwse-checker

Real-word spelling errors (RWSEs) pose special challenges for detection methods, as they ‘hide’ in the form of another existing word and in many cases even fit in syntactically.
rwse-checker is a modern Transformer-based implementation of earlier probabilistic methods based on confusion sets.
It detects RWSEs with a good balance between missing errors and raising too many false alarms. 
The confusion sets are dynamically configurable, allowing teachers to easily adjust which errors trigger feedback.

## Example Usage

```
from rwse import RWSE_Checker 

checker = RWSE_Checker()
checker.set_confusion_sets([['their','there'],['to','too','two']])

print(checker.check("there", "I want to buy [MASK] cars."))
print(checker.check("too", "I want [MASK] buy their cars."))
```
which yields
```
('their', 0.003510827198624611)
('to', 0.9989504218101501)
```
