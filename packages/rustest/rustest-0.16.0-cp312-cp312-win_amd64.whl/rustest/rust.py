"""Fallback stub for the compiled rustest extension.

This module is packaged with the Python distribution so unit tests can import the
package without building the Rust extension. Individual tests are expected to
monkeypatch the functions they exercise. Keeping this stub lightweight makes it
easy to trigger CI rebuilds without touching the compiled extension itself.
