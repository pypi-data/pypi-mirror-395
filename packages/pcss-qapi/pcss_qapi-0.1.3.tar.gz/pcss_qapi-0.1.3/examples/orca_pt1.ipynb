Notice that angles are passed as radians, so beam splitter with angle set to integer * Pi will work as it would have it's angle set to 0. You can also change the input_state however you want, but keep in mind, that bigger input state complexifies the circuit and lenghtens processing time. It is worth to mention that on real hardware length of the input_state doesn't have that much impact on the processing time as number of photons does.

    "But remember that there are only so many available ones, so if you do not have to, do not run thousands of samples. Real hardware is rather small. It has 8 qumodes and 2 loops which means that the highest length of the input state can be 8 and you can use either 1 or 2 loops, but the lengths are fixed to 1. Also keep in mind that producing singular photons is really hard, so running circuits with more than 4 photons can already be slow. Producing these photons requires shooting laser into a crystal, but in order for that to work the source of the laser has to warm up. So if you are the first user to use the PT-1 it may take additional time. It all sounds like PT-1 has many limitations, but it is the first of it's kind and it's next generation is already being tested and the results are quite convincing. By researching PT-1 we pave the way for the future."
