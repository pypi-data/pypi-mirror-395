This module adds the *Honorific Title* and *Position fields* to partner
records, and displays the title in QWeb reports and website pages that
use the base.contactname template for partner name presentation.

**Table of contents**

.. contents::
   :local:

Configuration
=============

- Open the partner record.
- Fill in the Honorific Title and Position fields shown right below the
  Name field.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

If you migrate your database from a version earlier than 19.0 to version
19.0 or later (where res.partner.title no longer exists in the core),
it’s likely that your previous settings won’t survive the migration
process. In that case, you may need to manually update the partner
records with the appropriate titles.
