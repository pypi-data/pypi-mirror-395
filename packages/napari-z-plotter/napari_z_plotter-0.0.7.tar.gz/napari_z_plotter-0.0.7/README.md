# Interactive orthogonal profile plots in Napari

[demo.webm](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd565cd5-8742-4905-bf47-8f128c7d6f77)

In 2D view, hover over a location in the image to plot the intensity profile along the orthogonal (Z, or channel) axis at that location.

This project is part of an ongoing collaboration between the [EPFL Center for Imaging](https://imaging.epfl.ch/) and the [Bionanophotonic Systems Laboratory](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/bios/).
