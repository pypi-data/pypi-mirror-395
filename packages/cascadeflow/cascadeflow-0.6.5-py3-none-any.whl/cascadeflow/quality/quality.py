"""
Professional quality validation system for cascade decisions.

✅ Alignment scorer integrated and working
✅ Difficulty estimator integrated
✅ Alignment safety floor (0.30) prevents off-topic responses
✅ All signals properly tracked in validation details

MERGED VERSION: Added for_cascade() configuration (Phase 2)
- All existing configs preserved (for_production, for_development, strict)
- NEW: for_cascade() - optimized for 50-60% acceptance with 94%+ quality
- Backward compatible - existing code continues to work

CHANGELOG:
- Oct 7, 2025: Added for_cascade() method for cascade optimization
- Oct 13, 2025: Integrated alignment scorer + difficulty estimator
- Oct 13, 2025: Fixed imports to use relative imports (now in quality/ package)
