SQLAlchemy Models

This package contains all database models for the application.
Import your models here to make them available for Alembic migrations.

Example:
    from .base import Base
    from .user import User
    from .product import Product

All models must be imported here for Alembic to detect them!

from .base import Base

# Import your models below this line
# Example: from .user import User

__all__ = [
