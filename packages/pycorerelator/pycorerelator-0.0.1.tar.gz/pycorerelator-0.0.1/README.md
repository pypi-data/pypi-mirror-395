**pyCoreRelator** is a Python package designed for quantitative stratigraphic correlation across geological core and physical log data. The package performs segment-based (i.e., unit-based or bed-to-bed) correlation analysis by applying Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithms for automated signal alignment, while honoring fundamental stratigraphic principles (e.g., superposition, age succession, pinchouts). The main tool computes multiple measures for assessing correlation quality, under the assumption that higher signal similarity indicates stronger correlation. These quality metrics can also be used to identify optimal correlation solutions. In addition, the package provides utility functions for preprocessing log data (e.g., cleaning, gap filling) and core image data (e.g., image stitching, clipping, converting color profiles or scans into digital logs) for use in correlation assessment.

## Installation

Users can install **pyCoreRelator** directly from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pycorerelator/) with `pip` command:
```
pip install pycorerelator
```
or from `conda-forge` repository with `conda`:
```
conda install pycorerelator
```

- **Machine Learning Data Imputation**: Advanced ML-based gap filling for core log data using ensemble methods (Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM) with configurable feature weighting and trend constraints
- **Multi-dimensional Log Support**: Handle multiple log types (MS, CT, RGB, density) simultaneously with dependent or independent multi-dimentiaonl DTW approach
- **Visualizations**: DTW cost matrix and paths, segment-wise core correlations, animated sequences, and statistical analysis for the correlation solutions
