    "PoreSpy's `diffusive_size_factor_AI` includes the steps for predicting the diffusive size factors of the conduit images decribed [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2022.105086). Note that the diffusive conductance of the conduits can be then calculated by multiplying the size factor by diffusivity of the phase. The function takes in the images of segmented porous medium and returns an array of diffusive size factors for all conduits in the image. Therefore, the framework can be applied to both one conduit image as well as a segmented image of porous medium."
