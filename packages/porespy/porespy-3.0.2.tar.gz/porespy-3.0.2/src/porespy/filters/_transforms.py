    r"""
    Uses the Washburn equation to convert distance transform values to a capillary
    transform.

    Parameters
    ----------
    im : ndarray
        A boolean image describing the porous medium with ``True`` values indicating
        the phase of interest.
    dt : ndarray, optional
        The distance transform of the void phase. If not provided it will be
        calculated, so some time can be save if a pre-computed array is already
        available.
    sigma : scalar (default = 1.0)
        The surface tension of the fluid-fluid interface.
    theta : scalar (default = 180)
        The contact angle of the fluid-fluid-solid system, in degrees, measured through
        the non-wetting phase.  It must be >90.
    g : scalar (default = 0)
        The gravitational constant acting on the fluids. Gravity is assumed to act
        toward the x=0 axis. To have gravity act in different directions use
        `np.swapaxes(im, 0, ax)` where `ax` is the desired direction.
    rho_nwp : scalar
        The density of the non-wetting fluid
    rho_wp : scalar
        The density of the wetting fluid
    voxel_size : scalar (default = 0.0)
        The resolution of the image
    spacing : scalar (default = None)
        If a 2D image is provided, this value is used to compute the second
        radii of curvature.  Setting it to `np.inf` will make the calculation truly
        2D since only one radii of curvature is considered. Setting it to `None`
        will force the calculation to be 3D.  If `im` is 3D this argument is
        ignored.  This should be in units of physical length, not voxels.

    Notes
    -----
    All physical properties should be in self-consistent units, and it is strongly
    recommended to use SI for everything.
