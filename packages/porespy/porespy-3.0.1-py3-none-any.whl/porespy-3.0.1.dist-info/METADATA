# What is PoreSpy?

**PoreSpy** is a collection of image analysis tools used to extract
information from 3D images of porous materials (typically obtained from
X-ray tomography). There are many packages that offer generalized image
analysis tools (i.e **Skimage** and **Scipy.NDimage** in the Python environment,
**ImageJ**, **MatLab**'s Image Processing Toolbox), but they all require building
up complex scripts or macros to accomplish tasks of specific use to
porous media. The aim of **PoreSpy** is to provide a set of pre-written
tools for all the common porous media measurements.

**PoreSpy** relies heavily on
[scipy.ndimage](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/ndimage.html)
and [scikit-image](https://scikit-image.org/) also known as **skimage**.
The former contains an assortment of general image analysis tools such
as image morphology filters, while the latter offers more complex but
still general functions such as watershed segmentation. **PoreSpy** tries
not to duplicate any of these general functions so you will also have to
install and learn how to use them to get the most from **PoreSpy**. The
functions in PoreSpy are generally built up using several of the general
functions offered by **skimage** and **scipy**. There are a few functions
in **PoreSpy** that are implemented natively, but only when necessary.

# Capabilities

**PoreSpy** consists of the following modules:

- `generators`: Routines for generating artificial images of porous
    materials useful for testing and illustration
- `filters`: Functions that accept an image and return an altered
    image
- `metrics`: Tools for quantifying properties of images
- `networks`: Algorithms and tools for analyzing images as pore networks
- `simulations`: Physical simulations on images including drainage
- `visualization`: Helper functions for creating useful views of the
    image
- `io`: Functions for outputting image data in various formats for use in
    common software
- `tools`: Various useful tools for working with images
