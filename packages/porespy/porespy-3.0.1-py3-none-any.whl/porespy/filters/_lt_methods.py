    Each location is assigned the radius of the largest sphere that can reach it

    This function is essentially a local thickness filter but with access limitations
    so represents a form of porosimetry

    Parameters
    ----------
    im : ndarray
        Boolean image of the porous material
    dt : ndarray, optional
        The distance transform of the image
    inlets : ndarray, optional
        A boolean array the same sizes a `im`, with `True` values indicating the
        inlet locations. If not provided then all faces are used.
    method : str
        Which method to use to compute the local thickness. Options are:

        ======== ===================================================================
        Method   Description
        ======== ===================================================================
        'dt'     Uses distance transforms to perform erosion and dilation for each
                 radius in the image
        'dsi'     Uses brute-force to inserts spheres at each voxel
        'conv'   Uses FFT-based convolution to perform erosion and dilation for
                 each radius in the image
        ======== ===================================================================

    sizes : array_like or scalar
        This is only used if the method is `dt` or `conv`. If a list of values is
        provided they are used directly. If a scalar is provided then that number
        of points spanning the min and max of the distance transform are used.
        If `None`, then all the unique values in the distance transform are used,
        which may become time consuming. This can be sped up if `dt` is provided
        and rounded to the nearest integer first.
    smooth : bool, optional
        Indicates if protrusions should be removed from the faces of the spheres
        or not. Default is `True`.

    Returns
    -------
    sizes : ndarray
        In image with each voxel value indicating the largest overlapping sphere
        which can reach it from the given inlets.

        'bf'     Uses brute-force to inserts spheres at each voxel

        Indicates if protrusions should be removed from the faces of the spheres

    mask : ndarray, optional
        This is only used if the method is `bf` or `imj`.  A boolean mask indicating
        which sites to insert spheres at. If not provided then all `True` values in
        `im` are used.
    approx : bool, optional
        This is only used if the method is `imj`. If `True` the algorithm is more
        aggressive at skipping voxels to process, which speeds things up, but this
        sacrifices accuracy in terms of a voxel-by-voxel match with the reference
