def porosity(im, mask=None, fill_closed=False, fill_surface=False):
    r"""
    Calculates the porosity of an image assuming 1's are void space and 0's

    Parameters
    ----------
    im : ndarray
        Image of the void space with 1's indicating void phase (or ``True``)
        and 0's indicating the solid phase (or ``False``). All other values
        are ignored (see Notes).
    mask : ndarray
        An image the same size as `im` with `True` values indicting the domain. This
        argument is optional, but can be provided for images that don't fill the
        entire array, like cylindrical cores.  Note that setting values in `im`
        to 2 will also exclude them from consideration so provides the same effect
        as `mask`, but providing a `mask` is usually much easier.
    fill_closed : bool (default = `False`)
        A flag to indicate if closed pores (not connected to any image boundary)
        should be filled or not before computing the porosity.
    fill_surface : bool (default = `False`)
        A flag to indicate if surface pores connected only to one surface should be
        filled or not before computing the porosity.

    Returns
    -------
    porosity : float
        Calculated as the sum of all 1's divided by the sum of all 1's and 0's.

def radial_density_distribution(dt, bins=10, log=False, voxel_size=1):
    r"""
    Computes radial density function by analyzing the histogram of voxel
    values in the distance transform.  This function is defined by
    Torquato [1b]_ as:

        .. math::

            \int_0^\infty P(r)dr = 1.0

    where *P(r)dr* is the probability of finding a voxel at a lying at a radial
    distance between *r* and *dr* from the solid interface.  This is equivalent
    to a probability density function (*pdf*)

    The cumulative distribution is defined as:

        .. math::

            F(r) = \int_r^\infty P(r)dr

    which gives the fraction of pore-space with a radius larger than *r*. This
    is equivalent to the cumulative distribution function (*cdf*).

    Parameters
    ----------
    dt : ndarray
        A distance transform of the pore space.  Note that it is recommended to apply
        ``find_dt_artifacts`` to this image first, and set potentially
        erroneous values to 0 with ``dt[mask] = 0`` where
        ``mask = porespy.filters.find_dt_artifaces(dt)``.
    bins : int or array_like
        This number of bins (if int) or the location of the bins (if array).
        This argument is passed directly to Scipy's ``histogram`` function so
        see that docstring for more information.  The default is 10 bins, which
        reduces produces a relatively smooth distribution.
    log : boolean
        If ``True`` the size data is converted to log (base-10)
        values before processing.  This can help to plot wide size
        distributions or to better visualize the radii in the small size region.
        Note that you should not anti-log the radii values in the returned
        ``tuple``, since the binning is performed on the logged radii values.
    voxel_size : scalar
        The size of a voxel side in preferred units.  The default is 1, so the
        user can apply the scaling to the returned results after the fact.

    Returns
    -------
    result : Results object

        Attribute      Description

        *pdf*          Probability density function
        *cdf*          Cumulative density function

    Notes
    -----
    Torquato refers to this as the *pore-size density function*, and mentions
    that it is also known as the *pore-size distribution function*.  These
    terms are avoided here since they have specific connotations in porous
    media analysis.

def lineal_path_distribution(im, bins=10, voxel_size=1, log=False):
    r"""
    Determines the probability that a point lies within a certain distance
    of the opposite phase *along a specified direction*

    This relates directly the radial density function defined by Torquato [1c]_,
    but instead of reporting the probability of lying within a stated distance
    to the nearest solid in any direction, it considers only linear distances
    along orthogonal directions.The benefit of this is that anisotropy can be
    detected in materials by performing the analysis in multiple orthogonal
    directions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    im : ndarray
        An image with each voxel containing the distance to the nearest solid
        along a linear path, as produced by ``distance_transform_lin``.
    bins : int or array_like
        The number of bins or a list of specific bins to use
    voxel_size : scalar
        The side length of a voxel.  This is used to scale the chord lengths
        into real units.  Note this is applied *after* the binning, so
        ``bins``, if supplied, should be in terms of voxels, not length units.
    log : boolean
        If ``True`` (default) the size data is converted to log (base-10)
        values before processing.  This can help to plot wide size
        distributions or to better visualize data in the small size region.
        Note that you should not anti-log the radii values in the returned
        ``results``, since the binning is performed on the logged radii values.

    log=False,

    normalization="count",
):
    r"""
    Determines the distribution of chord lengths in an image containing chords.

    Parameters
    ----------
    im : ndarray
        An image with chords drawn in the pore space, as produced by
        ``apply_chords`` or ``apply_chords_3d``.  ``im`` can be either boolean,
        in which case each chord will be identified using ``scipy.ndimage.label``,
        or numerical values in case it is assumed that chords have already been
        identified and labeled. In both cases, the size of each chord will be
        computed as the number of voxels belonging to each labelled region.
    bins : scalar or array_like
        If a scalar is given it is interpreted as the number of bins to use,
        and if an array is given they are used as the bins directly.
    log : boolean
        If ``True`` (default) the size data is converted to log (base-10)
        values before processing.  This can help to plot wide size
        distributions or to better visualize the in the small size region.
        Note that you should not anti-log the radii values in the returned
        ``tuple``, since the binning is performed on the logged radii values.
    normalization : string
        Indicates how to normalize the bin heights.  Options are:

        *'count' or 'number'*
            (default) This simply counts the number of chords in each bin in
            the normal sense of a histogram.  This is the rigorous definition
            according to Torquato [1d]_.

        *'length'*
            This multiplies the number of chords in each bin by the
            chord length (i.e. bin size).  The normalization scheme accounts for
            the fact that long chords are less frequent than shorter chords,
            thus giving a more balanced distribution.

    voxel_size : scalar
        The size of a voxel side in preferred units.  The default is 1, so the
        user can apply the scaling to the returned results after the fact.

        The image of the void space on which the 2-point correlation is
        desired.

    result : Results object
        A custom object with the following data added as named attributes:

        'probability'
            The probability that two points of the stated separation distance
            are within the same phase

    Notes
    -----
    The brute-force approach means overlaying a grid of equally spaced points
    onto the image, calculating the distance between each and every pair of
    points, then counting the instances where both pairs lie in the void space.

    This approach uses a distance matrix so can consume memory very quickly for
    large 3D images and/or close spacing.  It is recommended to avoid this.

):
    r"""
    Converts a pc map into a capillary pressure curve

    Parameters
    ----------
    pc : ndarray
        A numpy array with each voxel containing the capillary pressure at which
        it was invaded. `-inf` indicates voxels which are filled with non-wetting
        fluid at all pressures, and `+inf` indicates voxels that are filled by
        wetting fluid at all pressures. Values in the solid phase are masked by
        `im` so are ignored.
    im : ndarray
        A numpy array with `True` values indicating the void space and `False`
        elsewhere. This is necessary to define the total void volume of the domain
        when computing the saturation.
    seq : ndarray, optional
        A numpy array with each voxel containing the sequence at which it was
        invaded. This is required when analyzing results from injection simulations
        since the pressures in `pc` do not correspond to the sequence in which
        they were filled.
    mode : str
        Indicates whether the invasion was a drainage or an imbibition process.
        Options are 'drainage' and 'imbibition'.
    fix_ends : bool (default is `True`)
        If `True` (default) this puts values at + and - infinity corresponding to
        maximum and minimum non-wetting phase saturations. This helps when plotting
        as it adds plateaus.
    pc_min, pc_max : float
        Minimum and maximum values to clip the capillary pressures. This is useful
        if the minimum or maximum capillary pressure values are -/+ infinity, which
        means they do not show up when plotting.  Using `pc_min=1` and `pc_max=1e6`
        for instance, will make plateaus render when plotting.

    Returns
    -------
    results : dataclass-like
        A dataclass like object with the following attributes:

        ================== =========================================================
        Attribute          Description
        ================== =========================================================
        pc                 The capillary pressure
        snwp               The fraction of void space filled by non-wetting
                           phase at each pressure in ``pc``
        ================== =========================================================

    Notes
    -----
    To use this function with the results of `porosimetry` or `ibip` the sizes map
    must be converted to a capillary pressure map first.  `drainage` and `invasion`
    both return capillary pressure maps which can be passed directly as `pc`.
