    r"""
    Perform a Medial Axis Guided Network ExtracTion (MAGNET) on an image of
    porous media.

    This is a modernized python implementation of a classical
    network extraction method. First, the skeleton of the provided image is
    determined. The skeleton can be computed in serial or parallel modes.
    Next, all the junction points of the skeleton are determined by using
    convolution including terminal points on the ends of branches. ClustersPores are
    then inserted at these points. The size of the pores inserted is based on
    the distance transform value at it's junction. This approach results in
    many long throats so more pores are added using a maximum filter along long
    throats to find openings. To ensure an efficient network extraction method,
    only the most fundamential pore and throat properties are returned.

    Parameters
    ------------
    im : ndarray
        An image of the porous material of interest. Be careful of floating
        solids in the 3D image as this will result in a hollow shell after
        taking the skeleton. Floating solids are removed from the image by
        default prior to taking the skeleton.
    sk : ndarray
        Optionally provide your own skeleton of the image. If `sk` is `None` the
        skeleton is computed using `skimage.morphology.skeleton_3d`.  A check
        is made to ensure no shells are found in the resulting skeleton.
    surface : boolean
        If `False` disconnected solid at the surface of the image is NOT
        trimmed. This is the default mode. However, if `True`, disconnected
        solid at the surface of the image is trimmed. This is NOT applied when
        im is 2d.
    parallel_kw : dict
        Dictionary containing the settings for parallelization by chunking. If
        `None` is provided, parallelization does not occur. The default is
        `None`. The optional settings include `divs` (scalar or list of scalars,
        default = [2, 2, 2]), `overlap` (scalar or list of scalars, optional),
        and `cores` (scalar, default is all available cores). See documentaion
        on `ps.networks.skeleton` for more information.
    voxel_size : scalar (default = 1)
        The resolution of the image, expressed as the length of one side of a
        voxel, so the volume of a voxel would be voxel_size-cubed
    s : int (default = None)
        The hard threshold for determining "near" junctions. If None is passed,
        then the distance transform is used to merge junctions. The default is
        None.
    l_max : scalar (default = 7)
        The size of the maximum filter used in finding junction along long
        throats. This argument is only used when throat_junctions is set to
        "maximum filter" mode.
    throat_junctions : str
        The mode to use when finding throat junctions. The options are "maximum
        filter" or "fast marching". If None is given, then throat junctions are
        not found (this is the default).
    throat_area: boolean (default = FALSE)
        Set this argument to TRUE to calculate throat area using
        get_throat_area. The area is calculated at the throat voxel with the
        minimum distance transform value. If TRUE, an equivalent throat
        diameter is returned. The default value is FALSE, for computational
        efficiency sake. See get_throat_area() documentation for more
        information.

    Returns
    -------
    results : Results object
        A custom object with the following data added as named attributes:
        'network'
        A dictionary containing the most important pore and throat size data
        and topological data.
        'sk'
        The skeleton of the image is also returned.
        'juncs'
        An ndarray the same shape as `im` with clusters of junction voxels not
        uniquely labelled.
        'throat_area'
        If throat_area argument is set to FALSE (default), then None is
        returned. However, if throat_area is set to TRUE, then the measured
        throat area from get_throat_area is returned here.

def skeleton(im, surface=False, parallel_kw=None):
    r"""
    Takes the skeleton of an image. This function ensures that no shells are
    found in the resulting skeleton by trimming floating solids from the image
    beforehand and by checking for shells after taking the skeleton. The
    skeleton is taken using Lee's method as available in scikit-image. For
    faster skeletonization, a parallel mode is available.

    Parameters
    ----------
    im : ndarray
        A binary image of porous media with 'True' values indicating phase of
        interest.
    surface : boolean
        If `False` disconnected solid at the surface of the image is NOT
        trimmed. This is the default mode. However, if `True`, disconnected
        solid at the surface of the image is trimmed. Note that disconnected
        solids are NOT removed if a 2D image is passed.
     parallel_kw : dict
         Dictionary containing the settings for parallelization by chunking. If
         `None` is provided, parallelization does not occur. The default is
         `None`.

         The optional settings include `divs` (scalar or list of scalars,
         default = [2, 2, 2]), `overlap` (scalar or list of scalars, optional),
         and `cores` (scalar, default is all available cores).

         `divs` is the number of times to divide the image for parallel
         processing. If `1` then parallel processing does not occur. `2` is
         equivalent to `[2, 2, 2]` for a 3D image. If a list is provided, each
         respective axis will be divided by its corresponding number in the
         list. For example, [2, 3, 4] will divide z, y, and x axis to 2, 3,
         and 4 respectively.

         `overlap` is the amount of overlap to include when dividing up the
         image. This value will almost always be the size (i.e. raduis) of the
         structuring element. If not specified then the amount of overlap
         is inferred from the size of the structuring element, in which
         case the `strel_arg` must be specified.

         `cores` is the number of cores that will be used to parallel process
         all domains. If ``None`` then all cores will be used but user can
         specify any integer values to control the memory usage. Setting value
         to 1 will effectively process the chunks in serial to minimize memory
         usage.

    r"""
    Finds pore centers from an image of junctions. To do this, clusters of
    junction points are reduced to a single voxel, whereby the new voxel,
    corresponds to the one that has the largest distance transform value from
    within the original cluster. This method, ensures that the 'pore centre'
    lies on the original set of voxels.

    Parameters
    ----------
    juncs : ndarray
        An ndarray the same shape as `dt` with clusters of junction voxels
        uniquely labelled (1...Np).  If a boolean array is provided then a
        cluster labeling is performed with full cubic connectivity.

    dt : ndarray
        The distance transform of the original image.

    Returns
    -------
    pc : ndarray
        The resulting pore centres labelled

    juncs : ndarray
        An ndarray the same shape as `im` with clusters of junction voxels

        The distance transform of the image.
    throat_area : ndarray
        The throat area returned from get_throat_area where the labelled voxels

    voxel_size : scalar (default = 1)
        The resolution of the image, expressed as the length of one side of a
        voxel, so the volume of a voxel would be **voxel_size**-cubed.

    ----------

    path: ndarray 1 by N_walkers by 6
        The array used to keep track of the positions or path that each walker
        takes. Upon each step, this array is incremented by one in the first
        axis. The second axis corresponds to the number of total walkers while

        phi in that order. The labels given to each walker are asigned

    n_walkers_total : int

        number of walkers per throat.
    max_n_steps : int (optional)

        An ndarray the same shape as `im` with clusters of throat voxels
        uniquely labelled (1...Nt). If a boolean array is provided then a
        cluster labeling is performed with full cubic connectivity. Walkers are

        will reduce the amount of imformation available. It is important that

    voxel_size : scalar (default = 1)
        The resolution of the image, expressed as the length of one side of a
        voxel, so the volume of a voxel would be voxel_size-cubed
    n_walkers: int (default=10)

        two directions perpendicular to normal in 2D.
    step_size : float or ndarray (default=0.5)
        The size of each step to take. This is equivalent to r in spherical
