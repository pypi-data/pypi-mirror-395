def size_to_seq(size, im=None, bins=None, mode='drainage'):
    r"""
    Converts a size map to a sequence map

    Parameters
    ----------
    size : ndarray
        The image containing invasion size in each voxel. Values of 0 are
        assumed to be solid (if ``im`` is not given) and values of -1 are
        assumed to be uninvaded.
    im : ndarray, optional
        A binary image of the porous media, with ``True`` indicating the
        void space and ``False`` indicating the solid phase. If not given
        then it is assumed that the solid is identified as ``size == 0``.
    bins : array_like or int (optional)
        The bins to use when converting sizes to sequence.  The default is
        to create 1 bin for each unique value in ``size`` (except for -1 and 0).
        If an **int** is supplied, it is interpreted as the number of bins between 1
        and the maximum value in ``size``.  If an array is supplied it is used as
        the bins directly.
    mode : str
        Controls how the sizes are converted to a sequence. The options are:

        ============= ==============================================================
        `mode`        Description
        ============= ==============================================================
        'drainage'    The sizes are assumed to have been filled from largest to
                      smallest, ignoring 0's and -1's
        'imbibition'  The sizes are assumed to have been filled from smallest to
                      largest, ignoring 0's and -1's
        ============= ==============================================================

    Returns
    -------
    seq : ndarray
        An ndarray the same shape as ``size`` with invasion size values
        replaced by the invasion sequence, according to the specified `mode`.
        Any uninvaded voxels, indicated by -1 in ``size`` will be indicated by
        -1 in ``seq``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    size : ndarray
        The image containing invasion size values in each voxel. Solid

    im : ndarray, optional
        A binary image of the porous media, with ``True`` indicating the
        void space and ``False`` indicating the solid phase. If not given
        then it is assumed that the solid is identified as ``size == 0``.
    bins : array_like or int (optional)
        The bins to use when converting sizes to saturation.  The default is
        to create 1 bin for each unique value in ``size``.  If an **int**
        is supplied it is interpreted as the number of bins between 0 and the

        An ndarray the same shape as ``size`` but with size values replaced
        by the fraction of void space invaded at each size, according to the
        specified `mode`. Solid voxels and uninvaded voxels are represented by 0
        and -1, respectively.

    Notes
    -----
    If any ``-1`` values are present in `size` the maximum saturation will be less
    than 1.0 since this means that not all wetting phase was displaced.

    Parameters
    ----------
    seq : ndarray
        The image containing invasion sequence values in each voxel. Residual phase
        should be indicated as 0's and uninvaded (i.e. trapped) voxels as -1.
        `im` is used to mask to remove solid voxels from computation
    im : ndarray
        A binary image of the porous media, with ``True`` indicating the
        void space and ``False`` indicating the solid phase.
    mode : str

        'imbibition'  The saturation is assumed to decrease with increasing sequence
        ============= ==============================================================

    Returns
    -------
    satn : ndarray
        An ndarray the same shape as ``seq`` but with sequence values replaced
        by the fraction of void space invaded at the sequence number, accounting
        for the specified `mode`. Residual fluid and uninvaded voxels are represented
        by 0 and -1, respectively.  Solie phase is also represented as 0, so `im`
        must be used as a mask.

    Notes
    -----
    If any `-1` values are present in `seq` the maximum saturation will be less
    than 1.0 since this means that not all defending phase was displaced. If any
    `0` are present in `seq` then the minimum saturation will be greater than 0,
    since this means some invading phase was already present.

    im : ndarray
        A Numpy array with ``True`` values indicating the void space. This is

        Uninvaded voxels (either trapped wp during drainage or trapped nwp during
