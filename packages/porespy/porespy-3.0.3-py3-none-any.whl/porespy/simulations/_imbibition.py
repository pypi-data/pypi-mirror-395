    Performs a distance transform based imbibition simulation using distance

    Parameters
    ----------
    im : ndarray
        The boolean image of the void space on which to perform the simulation
    inlets : ndarray (optional)
        A boolean array with `True` values indicating the inlet locations for the
        invading (wetting) fluid. If not provided then access limitations will
        not be applied, meaning that the invading fluid can appear anywhere within
        the domain.
    outlets : ndarray (optional)
        A boolean array with `True` values indicating the outlet locations through
        which defending (non-wetting) phase would exit the domain. If not provided
        then trapping of the non-wetting phase is ignored.
    dt : ndarray, optional
        The distance transform of the void space. This is optional, but providing
        it if it is already available save some time. Also, it can be converted to
        integer type or round to fewer decimal places to reduce the number of unique
        sphere sizes to insert if `steps=None`.
    steps : scalar or array_like
        Controls which sphere sizes to invade. If an `int` then this many steps
        between 1 and the maximum size are used. A `tuple` is treated as the start
        and stop of the integer values. A `list` or `ndarray` is used directly. If

    Parameters
    ----------
    im : ndarray
        The image of the porous materials with void indicated by ``True``

        An array containing precomputed capillary pressure values in each
        voxel. This can include gravity effects or not. This can be generated
        by `capillary_transform`. If not provided then `2/dt` is used.
    dt : ndarray (optional)
        The distance transform of `im`.  If not provided it will be
        calculated, so supplying it saves time.
    inlets : ndarray
        An image the same shape as `im` with `True` values indicating the
        wetting fluid inlet(s).  If `None` then the wetting film is able to
        appear anywhere within the domain.
    outlets : ndarray, optional
        A boolean image with ``True`` values indicating the outlet locations.
        If this is provided then trapped voxels of non-wetting phase are found and
        all the output images are adjusted accordingly.
    residual : ndarray, optional
        A boolean mask the same shape as `im` with `True` values
        indicating to locations of residual wetting phase.
    steps : int or array_like (default = 25)
        The range of pressures to apply. If an integer is given then logarithmically
        spaced steps will be created between the lowest and highest pressures in
        `pc`. If a `list` is given, each value in the list is used directly, in
        order.
    min_size : int
        Any clusters of trapped voxels smaller than this size will be set to not
        trapped. This argument is only used if `outlets` is given. This is useful
        to prevent small voxels along edges of the void space from being set to
        trapped. These can appear to be trapped due to the jagged nature of the
        digital image. The default is 0, meaning this adjustment is not applied,
        but a value of 3 or 4 is recommended to activate this adjustment.
    conn : str
        Can be either `'min'` or `'max'` and controls the shape of the structuring
        element used to determine voxel connectivity when assessing trapping. The
        default is `'min'` which imposes the strictest criteria, so that voxels
        must share a face to be considered connected.

    Returns
    -------
    results : Result Object
        A dataclass-like object with the following attributes:

        =========== ===========================================================
        Attribute   Description
        =========== ===========================================================
        im_pc       An ndarray with each voxel indicating the step number at
                    which it was first invaded by wetting phase.
        im_seq      A numpy array with each voxel value indicating the sequence
                    at which it was invaded by the wetting phase.  Values of -1
                    indicate that it was not invaded, either because it was
                    trapped, inaccessbile, or sufficient pressure was not
                    reached.
        im_snwp     A numpy array with each voxel value indicating the global
                    non-wetting phase saturation at the point it was invaded.
        im_trapped  A numpy array with ``True`` values indicating trapped
                    voxels if `outlets` was provided, otherwise will be `None`.
        pc          1D array of capillary pressure values that were applied
        snwp        1D array of non-wetting phase saturations for each applied
                    value of capillary pressure (``pc``).
        =========== ===========================================================

    Notes
    -----
    The simulation proceeds as though the non-wetting phase pressure is very
    high and is incrementally lowered. Then imbibition occurs into the smallest
    accessible regions at each step. Closed or inaccessible pores are assumed
    to be filled with wetting phase.
