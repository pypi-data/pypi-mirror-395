    Performs a distance transform based drainage simulation using distance transform

    Parameters
    ----------
    im : ndarray
        The boolean image of the void space on which to perform the simulation
    inlets : ndarray (optional)
        A boolean array with `True` values indicating the inlet locations for the
        invading (non-wetting) fluid. If not provided then access limitations will
        not be applied, meaning that the invading fluid can appear anywhere within
        the domain.
    outlets : ndarray (optional)
        A boolean array with `True` values indicating the outlet locations through
        which defending (wetting) phase would exit the domain. If not provided then
        trapping of the wetting phase is ignored.
    dt : ndarray, optional
        The distance transform of the void space. This is optional, but providing
        it if it is already available saved some time.
    steps : scalar or array_like
        Controls which sphere sizes to invade. If an `int` then this many steps
        between 1 and the maximum size are used. A `tuple` is treated as the start
        and stop of the integer values. A `list` or `ndarray` is used directly. If
        `None` (default) then each unique value in the distance transform is used.

    Simulate drainage using image-based sphere insertion, optionally including

    Parameters
    ----------
    im : ndarray
        The image of the porous media with ``True`` values indicating the
        void space.
    pc : ndarray, optional
        Precomputed capillary pressure transform which is used to determine
        the invadability of each voxel. If not provided then it is calculated
        as `2/dt`.
    dt : ndarray (optional)
        The distance transform of ``im``. If not provided it will be calculated,
        so supplying it saves time.
    inlets : ndarray, optional
        A boolean image the same shape as ``im``, with ``True`` values
        indicating the inlet locations. If not specified then access limitations
        are not applied so invading phase can appear anywhere within the domain.
    outlets : ndarray, optional
        A boolean image with ``True`` values indicating the outlet locations.
        If this is provided then trapped voxels of wetting phase are found and
        all the output images are adjusted accordingly.
    residual : ndarray, optional
        A boolean array indicating the locations of any residual invading
        phase. This is added to the intermediate image prior to trimming
        disconnected clusters, so will create connections to some clusters
        that would otherwise be removed. The residual phase is indicated
        in the capillary pressure map by ``-np.inf`` values, since these voxels
        are invaded at all applied capillary pressures.
    steps : int or array_like (default = 25)
        The range of pressures to apply. If an integer is given then the given
        number of steps will be created between the lowest and highest values in
        ``pc``. If a list is given, each value in the list is used in ascending
        order. If `None` is given then all the possible values in `pc`
        are used.
    conn : str
        Controls the shape of the structuring element used to find neighboring
        voxels when looking at connectivity of invading blobs.  Options are:

        ========= =============================================================
        Option    Description
        ========= =============================================================
        'min'     This corresponds to a cross with 4 neighbors in 2D and 6
                  neighbors in 3D.
        'max'     This corresponds to a square or cube with 8 neighbors in 2D
                  and 26 neighbors in 3D.
        ========= =============================================================

    min_size : int
        Any clusters of trapped voxels smaller than this size will be set to not
        trapped. This argument is only used if `outlets` is given. This is useful
        to prevent small voxels along edges of the void space from being set to
        trapped. These can appear to be trapped due to the jagged nature of the
        digital image. The default is 0, meaning this adjustment is not applied,
        but a value of 3 or 4 is recommended to activate this adjustment.

        `im_seq`     An ndarray with each voxel indicating the step number at
                     which it was first invaded by non-wetting phase. -1 indicates
                     uninvaded, either due to the maximum pressure being too low,
                     or trapping, while 0 indicates residual.
        `im_pc`      A numpy array with each voxel value indicating the capillary
                     pressure at which it was invaded. `inf` indicates uninvaded,
                     either due to the maximum pressure being too low, or due to
                     trapping.
        `im_snwp`    A numpy array with each voxel value indicating the global
                     value of the non-wetting phase saturation at the point it
                     was invaded. -1 indicates uninvaded, either due to the maximum
                     pressure being too low, or trapping, while 0 indicates
                     residual.
        `im_size`    A numpy array with each voxel containing the radius of the
                     sphere, in voxels, that first overlapped it. `inf` indicates
                     uninvaded, either due to the maximum pressure being too low,
                     or trapping, while 0 indicates residual.
        `im_trapped` A numpy array with ``True`` values indicating trapped voxels.
                     If `outlets` was not provided it will be all `False`.
        `pc`         1D array of capillary pressure values that were applied.
        `swnp`       1D array of non-wetting phase saturations for each applied
                     value of capillary pressure (``pc``).
