# pyTensorlab

pyTensorlab is a Python package for tensor computations and complex optimization. The
packages provides the following:

- data types to represent sparse, incomplete, structured and decomposed tensors
  efficiently;
- tools to generate and work with these data types effectively and efficiently;
- algorithms for computing the canonical polyadic decomposition, the multilinear
  singular value decomposition, the Tucker decomposition or low multilinear rank
  approximation and the tensor-train decomposition;
- tensorization techniques relying on statistics or Hankelization;
- visualization routines;
- preconditioned Gauss-Newton type optimization methods for complex variables;
- fully typed code, which facilitates development.

pyTensorlab is a reimplementation of the Matlab toolbox
[Tensorlab](https://www.tensorlab.net). Currently, the feature set is not identical. The
Matlab toolbox also supports block term decompositions and has a structured data fusion
framework which relies on a domain specific language to easily model coupled matrix and
tensor decompositions and prior knowledge. On the other hand, pyTensorlab provides basic
support for the TT decomposition and a more complete set of complex Gauss-Newton type
optimization algorithms.

## Getting Started

To install pyTensorlab, use:

```console
$ pip install pytensorlab
```

pyTensorlab requires Python 3.10 to take advantage of new typing features. NumPy, SciPy
and Numba for underly the main computations. Pymanopt is used for manifold-based
optimization for low multilinear rank approximation and Vedo for visualization.

As an example, the canonical polyadic decomposition of a noisy rank-3 tensor can be
computed as follows:

```python
>>> import pytensorlab as tl
>>> import numpy as np
>>> shape = (10, 11, 12)
>>> Tpd = tl.PolyadicTensor.random(shape, 3)
>>> Tn = tl.noisy(np.array(Tpd), snr=20)
>>> Tres, info = tl.cpd(Tn, nterm=3)
```
