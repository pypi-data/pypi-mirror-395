## Summary

Welcome to `f3dasm`, a **f**ramework for **d**ata-**d**riven **d**esign and **a**nalysis of **s**tructures and **m**aterials.

`f3dasm` introduces a general and user-friendly data-driven Python package for researchers and practitioners working on design and analysis of materials and structures. Some of the key features include:

-  **Modular design** 
    - The framework introduces flexible interfaces, allowing users to easily integrate their own models and algorithms.

- **Automatic data management**
    -  The framework automatically manages I/O processes, saving you time and effort implementing these common procedures.

- **Easy parallelization**
    - The framework manages parallelization of experiments, and is compatible with both local and high-performance cluster computing.

- **Built-in defaults**
    - The framework includes a collection of benchmark functions, optimization algorithms and sampling strategies to get you started right away!

- **Hydra integration**
    - The framework is supports the [hydra](https://hydra.cc/) configuration manager, to easily manage and run experiments.


## Getting started

`f3dasm` is available at [the Python Package Index]() and on [Anaconda Cloud](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/f3dasm). To get started:

```bash
# PyPI
$ pip install f3dasm
```

or

```bash
# PyPI
$ conda install conda-forge::f3dasm
```

* Follow the complete [installation instructions](https://f3dasm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) to get going!
* Read the [overview](https://f3dasm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) section, containing a brief introduction to the framework and a statement of need.
* Check out the tutorials section, containing a collection of examples to get you familiar with the framework.

## Illustrative benchmarks

This package includes a collection of illustrative benchmark studies that demonstrate the capabilities of the framework. These studies are available in the `/studies/` folder, and include the following studies:

- Benchmarking optimization algorithms against well-known benchmark functions
- 'Fragile Becomes Supercompressible' ([Bessa et al. (2019)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/adma.201904845))
