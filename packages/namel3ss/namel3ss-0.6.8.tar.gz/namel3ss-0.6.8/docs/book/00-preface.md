# Learn Namel3ss — Preface

Welcome to **Learn Namel3ss**. This book teaches you how to write, test, and ship AI-native applications using the modern English-style Namel3ss DSL. It assumes basic programming knowledge but no prior AI expertise. All code examples use the current, canonical language surface and tooling (`n3` CLI, Studio, VS Code extension), aligned with the runtime, lint engine, and deployment targets.

If you see legacy syntax out in the wild, don’t worry: the compiler can still parse it, and lint will nudge you toward the modern style. This book stays focused on the modern English-style surface so you can be productive immediately.

## How to read this book
- Move linearly for a complete journey from beginner to advanced.
- Try every snippet: save it to a `.ai` file and run it with the `n3` CLI or open it in Studio.
- Exercises are short and runnable; solutions appear later in the chapter or via hints.
- Links to examples under `examples/` show fully working apps you can explore and extend.

Happy building!
