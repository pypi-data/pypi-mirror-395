# Adjusted Identity Calculator for DNA Sequences

A Python package implementing MycoBLAST-style sequence identity calculations for DNA sequences, specifically designed for mycological DNA barcoding applications. This package provides sophisticated sequence alignment and scoring with various adjustments for homopolymer differences, IUPAC ambiguity codes, and sequencing artifacts.

**Based on the MycoBLAST algorithm developed by Stephen Russell and Mycota Lab.** See the foundational article: ["Why NCBI BLAST identity scores can be misleading for fungi"](https://mycotalab.substack.com/p/why-ncbi-blast-identity-scores-can) which explains the theoretical basis and motivation for these sequence preprocessing adjustments.

## Features

- **Homopolymer Length Normalization**: Ignore differences in homopolymer run lengths (e.g., "AAA" vs "AAAA")
- **Repeat Motif Adjustment**: Handle dinucleotide and longer repeat motifs (e.g., "ATATAT" vs "ATATATAT")
- **IUPAC Ambiguity Code Handling**: Allow different ambiguity codes to match via nucleotide intersection
- **MSA Dual-Gap Support**: Correctly handle sequences from multi-sequence alignments (MSA) where both sequences may have gaps at the same position
- **End Trimming**: Skip mismatches in terminal regions to avoid sequencing artifacts (disabled by default, set `end_skip_distance` to enable)
- **Indel Normalization**: Count contiguous indels as single evolutionary events
- **Comprehensive Alignment**: Multi-stage bidirectional alignment optimization using edlib
- **Flexible Configuration**: Enable/disable individual adjustments as needed

## Installation

### From GitHub

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/joshuaowalker/adjusted-identity.git
```

### Development Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/joshuaowalker/adjusted-identity.git
cd adjusted-identity
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Complete Solution (align + score)
```python
from adjusted_identity import align_and_score

# For raw sequences - handles alignment and scoring
result = align_and_score("ATCGAAAAATGTC", "ATCGAAAATGTC")
print(f"Adjusted identity: {result.identity:.3f}")
print(f"Coverage: seq1={result.seq1_coverage:.3f}, seq2={result.seq2_coverage:.3f}")
```

### Option 2: Core Scoring Only (use with your alignments)
```python
from adjusted_identity import score_alignment

# For pre-aligned sequences from BLAST, BioPython, etc.
aligned_seq1 = "ATCG-AAAT"  # From your alignment tool
aligned_seq2 = "ATCGAAAAT"  # From your alignment tool

result = score_alignment(aligned_seq1, aligned_seq2)
print(f"Adjusted identity: {result.identity:.3f}")
```

### Compare with Traditional Identity
```python
from adjusted_identity import align_and_score, RAW_ADJUSTMENT_PARAMS

# Traditional identity (no adjustments)
raw_result = align_and_score("ATCGAAAAATGTC", "ATCGAAAATGTC", RAW_ADJUSTMENT_PARAMS)
print(f"Traditional identity: {raw_result.identity:.3f}")

# Adjusted identity (with MycoBLAST adjustments)  
adj_result = align_and_score("ATCGAAAAATGTC", "ATCGAAAATGTC")
print(f"Adjusted identity: {adj_result.identity:.3f}")

# Examine the scoring pattern
print(f"Score pattern: {adj_result.score_aligned}")
# '|' = exact match, '=' = ambiguous/homopolymer, ' ' = substitution
```

## Use Cases

### Mycological DNA Barcoding

Common scenario: ITS sequences with homopolymer differences due to sequencing artifacts.

```python
from adjusted_identity import align_and_score

# Fungal ITS sequences with different homopolymer lengths
its_seq1 = "TCCGTAGGTGAACCTGCGGAAGGATCATTACCGAGTTTAAA"    # 3 A's at end
its_seq2 = "TCCGTAGGTGAACCTGCGGAAGGATCATTACCGAGTTTTAAAA"   # 4 A's at end

result = align_and_score(its_seq1, its_seq2)
print(f"Species identity: {result.identity:.3f}")  # Should be ~1.0 with homopolymer adjustment
```

### Handling Ambiguous Bases

```python
from adjusted_identity import align_and_score

# Sequences with IUPAC ambiguity codes
barcode1 = "ATCGRGTC"  # R = A or G
barcode2 = "ATCGKGTC"  # K = G or T (both R and K contain G)

result = align_and_score(barcode1, barcode2)
print(f"Identity with IUPAC handling: {result.identity:.3f}")  # Should be 1.0
print(f"Score pattern: {result.score_aligned}")  # Shows '=' for ambiguous matches
```

### Understanding Score Patterns

The `score_aligned` field provides a visual representation of how each position was scored:

- `|` = Exact match between standard nucleotides (A=A, C=C, G=G, T=T)
- `=` = Ambiguous match (IUPAC codes) or homopolymer/repeat extension
- ` ` (space) = Substitution (mismatch)
- `-` = Indel extension (normalized)
- `.` = End-trimmed, dual-gap, or overhang position (not scored)

```python
from adjusted_identity import align_and_score

result = align_and_score("ATCGRAAATGTC", "ATCGAAAAATGTC")
print(f"Seq1: {result.seq1_aligned}")
print(f"Seq2: {result.seq2_aligned}") 
print(f"Score: {result.score_aligned}")
# Output might show: ||||==||||||
#                    ATCG = exact matches (||||)
#                    R vs A = ambiguous match (=)
#                    AAA vs AAAA = homopolymer extension (=)
```

### Repeat Motif Handling

```python
from adjusted_identity import align_and_score, AdjustmentParams

# Dinucleotide repeat differences (AT repeat from Russell article)
seq1 = "CGATAT--C"  # Missing one AT unit
seq2 = "CGATATATC"  # Has extra AT unit

# With repeat motif adjustment (default)
result = align_and_score(seq1, seq2)
print(f"Adjusted identity: {result.identity:.3f}")  # Should be 1.0

# Control max repeat motif length
params = AdjustmentParams(
    max_repeat_motif_length=3  # Detect up to trinucleotide repeats (e.g., CAG)
)
result = align_and_score("CAGCAG---TTC", "CAGCAGCAGTTC", params)
```

### Multi-Sequence Alignment (MSA) Support

The package correctly handles sequence pairs extracted from multi-sequence alignments (MSA), where both sequences may have gaps at the same position due to alignment with third sequences.

```python
from adjusted_identity import score_alignment

# Sequences from MSA (e.g., spoa, MUSCLE, MAFFT output)
# Both sequences have gaps at positions 3-4 due to alignment with a third sequence
msa_seq1 = "AGA--TT"
msa_seq2 = "AGAT-TT"

result = score_alignment(msa_seq1, msa_seq2)
print(f"MSA identity: {result.identity:.3f}")  # Should be 1.0 - 'T' recognized as homopolymer
print(f"Score pattern: {result.score_aligned}")

# Another example with consensus-based homopolymer detection
msa_seq1 = "AGG-AC"  # G at position 2
msa_seq2 = "AG-GAC"  # G at position 3

result = score_alignment(msa_seq1, msa_seq2)
print(f"MSA identity: {result.identity:.3f}")  # Both G's recognized as homopolymer extensions
```

**Key MSA features:**
- **Dual-gap handling**: Positions where both sequences have '-' are excluded from scoring (marked with `.`)
- **Consensus context**: Homopolymer detection uses consensus nucleotides from both sequences
- **Conflict resolution**: When sequences disagree at context positions, homopolymer extension is not applied

### Custom Adjustments

```python
from adjusted_identity import align_and_score, AdjustmentParams

# Custom adjustment parameters
custom_params = AdjustmentParams(
    normalize_homopolymers=True,   # Enable homopolymer adjustment
    handle_iupac_overlap=False,    # Disable IUPAC intersection
    normalize_indels=True,         # Enable indel normalization
    end_skip_distance=10,         # Skip 10bp from each end (default is 0 = disabled)
    max_repeat_motif_length=2     # Detect up to dinucleotide repeats (default)
)

result = align_and_score(seq1, seq2, custom_params)
```

## API Architecture

This package provides a **layered API design** that separates sequence alignment from identity scoring, giving you maximum flexibility:

### Core Layer: `score_alignment()`
The **core implementation** that applies MycoBLAST-style adjustments to any pre-aligned sequences. This allows you to use **any alignment library** (BLAST, BioPython, edlib, etc.) with the adjusted identity algorithm.

**Input**: Just needs gapped sequences of equal length  
**Output**: Adjusted identity metrics with detailed scoring information

### Convenience Layer: `align_and_score()`
A **higher-level function** that combines fast edlib alignment with the scoring algorithm. Provides BLAST-like infix alignment that's fast enough for production use without requiring external dependencies.

**Input**: Raw unaligned sequences  
**Output**: Complete alignment and adjusted identity results

## Integration with Other Alignment Tools

The core `score_alignment()` function works with alignments from any source. Here are examples with popular alignment libraries:

### Using with NCBI BLAST

```python
# NOTE: This example is illustrative and not tested
from Bio.Blast import NCBIWWW, NCBIXML
from adjusted_identity import score_alignment

# Run BLAST search (example)
result_handle = NCBIWWW.qblast("blastn", "nt", query_sequence)
blast_records = NCBIXML.parse(result_handle)

for blast_record in blast_records:
    for alignment in blast_record.alignments:
        for hsp in alignment.hsps:
            # Extract aligned sequences from BLAST HSP
            query_aligned = hsp.query
            subject_aligned = hsp.sbjct
            
            # Apply adjusted identity scoring
            adj_result = score_alignment(query_aligned, subject_aligned)
            
            print(f"BLAST identity: {hsp.identities/hsp.align_length:.3f}")
            print(f"Adjusted identity: {adj_result.identity:.3f}")
```

### Using with BioPython PairwiseAligner

```python
from Bio import Align
from adjusted_identity import score_alignment

# Create BioPython aligner
aligner = Align.PairwiseAligner()
aligner.match_score = 2
aligner.mismatch_score = -1

# Example sequences
seq1 = "ATCGATCG"
seq2 = "ATCGTCG"  # Missing one nucleotide

# Perform alignment
alignments = aligner.align(seq1, seq2)
best_alignment = alignments[0]

# Extract aligned sequences using indexing (idiomatic BioPython)
seq1_aligned = str(best_alignment[0])
seq2_aligned = str(best_alignment[1])

# Apply adjusted scoring
result = score_alignment(seq1_aligned, seq2_aligned)
print(f"Adjusted identity: {result.identity:.3f}")
```

### Using with Custom/External Aligners

```python
# NOTE: This example is illustrative template code
from adjusted_identity import score_alignment

def process_alignment_file(alignment_file):
    """Process alignments from any external tool."""
    results = []
    
    # Parse your alignment format (FASTA, SAM, custom, etc.)
    for seq1_aligned, seq2_aligned in parse_alignment_file(alignment_file):
        # Ensure sequences are the same length
        assert len(seq1_aligned) == len(seq2_aligned)
        
        # Apply adjusted identity scoring
        result = score_alignment(seq1_aligned, seq2_aligned)
        results.append(result)
    
    return results
```

## Understanding End Trimming Behavior

The `end_skip_distance` parameter implements "digital end trimming" to skip sequencing artifacts near read ends. **Important**: This parameter counts **nucleotides** (non-gap characters), not alignment positions.

### Automatic Activation

End trimming only activates when sequences are long enough:

```python
from adjusted_identity import align_and_score, AdjustmentParams

# Short sequences (< 2 × end_skip_distance nucleotides): NO trimming applied
short_seq1 = "ATCGATCG"      # 8 nucleotides 
short_seq2 = "ATCGATCG"      # 8 nucleotides
result = align_and_score(short_seq1, short_seq2)  # end_skip_distance=0 by default
print(f"Scored positions: {result.scored_positions}")  # 8 (full sequence)
print(f"Score pattern: {result.score_aligned}")        # "||||||||" (no trimming dots)

# Long sequences (≥ 2 × end_skip_distance nucleotides): Trimming applied  
long_seq1 = "A" * 25 + "TCGX" + "T" * 25    # 54 nucleotides
long_seq2 = "A" * 25 + "TCGA" + "T" * 25    # 54 nucleotides
result = align_and_score(long_seq1, long_seq2)
print(f"Scored positions: {result.scored_positions}")  # ~14 (middle region only)
print(f"Score pattern: {result.score_aligned}")        # ".......|||| |||||......." (dots show trimmed regions)
```

### Nucleotide vs Position Counting

End trimming counts **actual nucleotides** in each sequence, ignoring gaps:

```python
# This alignment has gaps, but nucleotide counting still works correctly
seq1_aligned = "AAA---TCGATCG---TTT"  # 12 nucleotides (ignoring gaps)
seq2_aligned = "---AAATCGATCGTTT---"  # 12 nucleotides (ignoring gaps)

# With end_skip_distance=5: skips first 5 and last 5 nucleotides from each sequence
# Only the middle "TCGATCG" region (2 nucleotides) would be scored
```

### Customizing End Trimming

```python
# Disable end trimming completely
no_trim_params = AdjustmentParams(end_skip_distance=0)
result = align_and_score(long_seq1, long_seq2, no_trim_params)

# Use shorter trimming distance for smaller sequences
short_trim_params = AdjustmentParams(end_skip_distance=5) 
result = align_and_score(medium_seq1, medium_seq2, short_trim_params)
```

**Rule of thumb**: For sequences shorter than `2 × end_skip_distance` nucleotides, end trimming has no effect and the entire alignment is scored.

## Advanced Usage

### Batch Processing

```python
from adjusted_identity import align_and_score

sequences = [
    ("seq1", "ATCGATCGATCG"),
    ("seq2", "ATCGATCGATCC"),
    ("seq3", "ATCGATCGATCG"),
]

reference = sequences[0][1]
results = []

for name, seq in sequences[1:]:
    result = align_and_score(reference, seq)
    results.append({
        'name': name,
        'identity': result.identity,
        'coverage': min(result.seq1_coverage, result.seq2_coverage)
    })

# Sort by identity
results.sort(key=lambda x: x['identity'], reverse=True)
```

### Understanding Scoring Patterns

The `score_aligned` field shows how each position was scored:

```python
result = align_and_score("AAA-TTT", "AAAATTT")
print(result.score_aligned)  # "|||=|||"
# | = match
# = = homopolymer extension (ignored if adjustment enabled)
```

Scoring symbols:
- `|`: Exact match (A=A, C=C, G=G, T=T)
- `=`: Ambiguous match (IUPAC) or homopolymer/repeat extension
- ` ` (space): Substitution or indel start (counts as mismatch)
- `-`: Indel extension (ignored if normalization enabled)
- `.`: End-trimmed, dual-gap, or overhang (not scored)

## Background

This package implements the sequence preprocessing approach described in the MycoBLAST algorithm by Stephen Russell and Mycota Lab, adapted for general-purpose DNA sequence comparison. The foundational research is detailed in ["Why NCBI BLAST identity scores can be misleading for fungi"](https://mycotalab.substack.com/p/why-ncbi-blast-identity-scores-can).

### How the Variant Range Algorithm Works

Starting in v0.2.0, this package uses a **variant range algorithm** that provides more accurate scoring for complex indel patterns, especially in multi-sequence alignments.

**The key insight**: Standard aligners don't know about homopolymers—they just find the minimum-edit alignment. This can produce patterns where a simple homopolymer expansion looks like a complex substitution or scattered indels.

**How it works:**

1. **Find variant ranges**: Scan the alignment for contiguous regions where sequences differ (gaps, mismatches, or both). These are bounded by matching positions on each side.

2. **Extract alleles**: For each variant range, pull out the gap-free content from each sequence. For example, in `TGC-C-TC` vs `TGCT--TC`, the variant range yields alleles `"C"` and `"T"`.

3. **Check for extensions**: Ask whether each allele could be explained as a repeat of the adjacent context:
   - Does `"C"` extend the left context `C`? Yes (homopolymer)
   - Does `"T"` extend the right context `T`? Yes (homopolymer)

4. **Apply Occam's razor**: If both alleles are valid extensions of their respective contexts, they represent equivalent repeat expansions → **0 edits**. No mismatch is counted because both placements are biologically plausible.

**Example:**
```
seq1: ATTCA     Traditional scoring: 1 substitution (T vs C)
seq2: ATCCA     Variant range: T extends left T, C extends right C → 0 edits
```

This approach handles cases that position-by-position algorithms miss, such as "floating" nucleotides in MSA data where gap placement is arbitrary.

For the complete specification, see [docs/SCORING_SPEC.md](docs/SCORING_SPEC.md).

### Why These Adjustments Matter

The adjustments are particularly valuable for:

- **Fungal taxonomy**: ITS sequences often have homopolymer differences
- **DNA barcoding**: Technical artifacts can obscure phylogenetic signal
- **Sequence quality assessment**: End-trimming handles poor-quality regions
- **Phylogenetic analysis**: IUPAC codes preserve ambiguous but valid matches

**Credit**: This implementation is based on the MycoBLAST algorithm developed by Stephen Russell and Mycota Lab. The theoretical framework and biological motivation are thoroughly explained in their foundational article.

## Changelog

### Version 0.2.2

- **Removed**: `score_aligned_seq2` field (added in v0.2.1) has been removed
  - Analysis showed it was redundant: same as `score_aligned` 98% of the time
  - Scoring is symmetric: swap seq1/seq2 arguments to get the alternate perspective
  - This simplifies the API and reduces memory overhead

### Version 0.2.1

- **Bug Fix**: Fixed dual-gap handling so they don't split variant ranges (key regression test added)
- **Bug Fix**: Fixed visualization when one position is extension and other is core with matching cores
- Improved visualization for indel normalization: first core position shows ` `, subsequent show `-`

### Version 0.2.0
- **Major Enhancement**: Implemented variant range algorithm for improved homopolymer and repeat motif detection
- **Key behavioral change**: Alternating indel patterns like `TGC-C-TC` vs `TGCT--TC` now correctly score as identity=1.0
  - The algorithm recognizes that C extends the left C context and T extends the right T context
  - Both alleles are valid repeat extensions → 0 edits (Occam's razor principle)
- **Algorithm improvements**:
  - Variant regions are now bounded by non-gap match positions (respects alignment boundaries)
  - Alleles extracted from variant ranges are analyzed for left/right repeat extensions
  - Split scoring: partial extensions allowed (e.g., "AAG" where "AA" extends context scores AA as 0 edits, G as 1 edit)
  - Opposite direction extensions are valid (allele1 extending left + allele2 extending right = both valid)
- **IUPAC integration**: Motif matching uses `_are_nucleotides_equivalent()` so IUPAC codes can extend context
- **Breaking change**: `end_skip_distance` now defaults to 0 (disabled). Set `end_skip_distance=20` to restore previous behavior.
- Removed 218 lines of dead code from previous indel processing implementation

### Version 0.1.7
- **Feature**: Added multi-sequence alignment (MSA) dual-gap support for homopolymer normalization
- Consensus-based context extraction now handles sequences where both have gaps at the same position (common in MSA outputs from spoa, MUSCLE, MAFFT)
- Dual-gap positions ('-' vs '-') are now correctly treated as matches, not indels
- Homopolymer detection uses consensus from both sequences when extracting context
- Added 17 comprehensive tests for MSA edge cases
- 100% backward compatible - all 133 tests pass
- No API changes - existing code works unchanged

### Version 0.1.6
- **Enhancement**: Added validation for contradictory `AdjustmentParams` configuration
- Now raises `ValueError` when `normalize_homopolymers=True` but `max_repeat_motif_length < 1` (which would silently disable homopolymer normalization)
- Added comprehensive test coverage for parameter validation edge cases
- No API changes - existing valid configurations work unchanged

### Version 0.1.5
- **Enhancement**: Added `ambiguous_match` field to `ScoringFormat` to distinguish between exact nucleotide matches and ambiguous matches
- Modified `_are_nucleotides_equivalent()` to return a tuple indicating match type  
- Score patterns now show `|` for exact standard nucleotide matches (A=A, C=C, G=G, T=T) and `=` for any matches involving IUPAC ambiguity codes
- No breaking changes - existing code works unchanged but score visualization is more informative

### Version 0.1.4
- **Bug fix**: Fixed overhang scoring behavior when `end_skip_distance=0`
- Now correctly scores only positions where both sequences have content (no gap vs nucleotide scoring)
- Added comprehensive test suite for overhang region handling edge cases
- No API changes - existing code will work unchanged but may see different results for overhang alignments

### Version 0.1.3
- **Bug fix**: Fixed alignment length mismatch error in `align_edlib_bidirectional()`
- Resolved "Aligned sequences must have same length" errors for certain sequence pairs
- Simplified suffix trimming logic by removing unnecessary sequence trimming/reattachment
- No API changes or performance impact

### Version 0.1.2
