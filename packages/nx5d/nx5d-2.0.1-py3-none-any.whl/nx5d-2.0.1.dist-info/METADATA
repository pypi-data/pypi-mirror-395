Nx5d - Data Analysis Done Right
===============================

`nx5d` is a scientific data analysis framework aiming
at a high degree of automation. It is centered around the
[Spice Concept](#./doc/concepts.md#the-spice-concept),
a management mechanism for defaults and customization
of analysis settings.

Although originates from the KMC3-XPP beamline of BESSY-II
and was built around pump-probe X-ray diffraction requirements,
it's actually intended as an application-agnostic
framework suitable for any scan-oriented data anlysis
workflows. If you come from a different background
and wish to dip your toes in Nx5d, the authors will love
to hear about it.


Why Yet Another Analysis Framework?...
--------------------------------------

In short: because people should be free to do "people things".

The main motivation behind Nx5d is to use computers at what
they're good for -- doing menial, stupid, repeptitive work.
Instead of being wasted on managing boilerplate code for data
transformation, a scientist's cognitive potential should be used
for the things that a computer *can't* do:
understanding things and creating insight.


Can I use it right away?
------------------------

Probably not today.

As of now, september 2025, 
it's still very much work-in-progress where it's really
just the basic concepts that have barely settled. It has lots
of sharp edges, and to add insult to injury, it *severly* lacks
in the [documentation](https://nx5d.readthedocs.io/) department.

Having said that, it's in a *kind-of-usable* state,
being used on a daily basis at the author's home beamline.
The current main focus is indeed documenting and cleaning
up the basic tools and APIs, and they're getting better suited
for a broader audience by the day.

If you consider yourself the adventurous, slightly impatient type,
and still insist on dipping your does in *right now*, by all
means... go ahead!
You are strongly encouraged to get in contact with the authors for
a closer collaboration and support.


Caveats & Bugs
--------------

Not enough code to call them "bugs" yet. We call them "gaping, deep,
dark holes." :-p

Also, most of Nx5d is being developed and tested primarily on Linux.
But we'd love to see it perform more robustly on Windows, if we
receive help by testing and quality patches.
