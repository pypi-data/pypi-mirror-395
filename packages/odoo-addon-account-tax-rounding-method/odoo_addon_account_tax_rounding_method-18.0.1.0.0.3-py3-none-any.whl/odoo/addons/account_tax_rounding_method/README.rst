This module provides the ability to configure tax rounding methods in
invoices and other business documents such as sales orders and purchase
orders. Supported methods include Half-up (Default), Round-up, and
Round-down.

Only 'exclusive' taxes are supported, and the rounding behavior is
limited to the ``round_globally`` option of the
``tax_calculation_rounding_method``. It assumes that the
``round_per_line`` method is not used in Japan.

Use Cases / Context
===================

By default, Odoo uses the "HALF-UP" method to round tax amounts.
However, in some regions, such as Japan, some industries have a common
practice of rounding down instead. This module accommodates various
regional practices by providing configurable tax rounding options:
Half-up, Round-up, and Round-down.

Configuration
=============

1. Set the company-wide default

   - Go to Accounting (or Invoicing) → Configuration → Settings
   - In the Tax Rounding Method section, select the rounding method to
     apply by default for all transactions

2. (Optional) Set a partner-specific rounding method

   - Go to Contacts → Select a partner
   - In the Accounting tab:

     - Select the rounding method to apply for that partner in the Tax
       Rounding Method

3. Priority of settings

   - If partner-specific rounding is enabled, it will override the
     company-level setting
   - If not enabled, the company-level setting will be used

Usage
=====

With the tax rounding method set to "Half-up", if you create an invoice
in JPY with the following line:

- Quantity: 1
- Unit Price: 15
- Tax: 10% (excluded)

the calculated tax amount will be 2.

With the tax rounding method set to "Round-up", if you create an invoice
in JPY with the following line:

- Quantity: 1
- Unit Price: 13
- Tax: 10% (excluded)

the calculated tax amount will be 2.

With the tax rounding method set to "Round-down", if you create an
invoice in JPY with the following line:

- Quantity: 1
- Unit Price: 15
- Tax: 10% (excluded)

the calculated tax amount will be 1.
