Integration Compatibility Test for Weight Processing
====================================================

This test verifies that:
1. HookedTransformer with processing matches expected Main Demo values (3.999 → 5.453)
2. HookedTransformer without processing matches expected unprocessed values (~3.999 → ~4.117)
3. TransformerBridge with processing matches HookedTransformer with processing
4. TransformerBridge without processing matches HookedTransformer without processing
5. Processing maintains mathematical equivalence for baseline computation
6. Processing changes ablation results as expected (for better interpretability)
