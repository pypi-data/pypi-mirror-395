## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Challenges

**"This is just marketing hype"**
- **Mitigation:** Working demo anyone can run, full source code, technical depth in Reddit/HN posts

**"87% confidence seems inflated"**
- **Mitigation:** Explain methodology clearly, honest about limitations, show calculation basis

**"Why not just use existing tools?"**
- **Mitigation:** Emphasize cross-domain uniqueness, show what others can't do, complementary not replacement

**"Fair Source isn't really open source"**
- **Mitigation:** Be transparent, explain sustainability model, auto-convert to Apache 2.0 in 4 years

**"Healthcare comparison is a stretch"**
- **Mitigation:** Cite Joint Commission research, show root cause parallels, let community validate

### Response Strategy

**For all criticism:**
1. Respond quickly (within 1 hour)
2. Don't be defensive
3. Provide evidence and links
4. Invite deeper discussion
5. Thank them for feedback
6. Update content if valid points raised
