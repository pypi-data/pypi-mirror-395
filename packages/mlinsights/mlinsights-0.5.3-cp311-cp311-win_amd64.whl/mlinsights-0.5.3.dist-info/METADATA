*mlinsights* extends *scikit-learn* with a couple of new models,
transformers, metrics, plotting. It provides new trainers such as
**QuantileLinearRegression** which trains a linear regression with *L1* norm
non-linear correlation based on decision trees, or
**QuantileMLPRegressor** a modification of scikit-learn's MLPRegressor
which trains a multi-layer perceptron with *L1* norm.
It also explores **PredictableTSNE** which trains a supervized
model to replicate *t-SNE* results or a **PiecewiseRegression**
which partitions the data before fitting a model on each bucket.
**PiecewiseTreeRegressor** trains a piecewise regressor using
a linear regression on each piece. **IntervalRegressor** produces
confidence interval by using bootstrapping. **ApproximateNMFPredictor**
approximates a NMF to produce prediction without retraining.
