    ----------
    mode
        ``"snapshot"`` for warmup snapshot passes, ``"delta"`` after warmup when
        updates originate from QCoDeS callbacks.
    readings
        The readings that were ingested in this batch.
    change_events
        Change events generated by the state store for this batch.
    current_state
        Callable that returns the latest full state when invoked. The callable is
        provided to allow lazy evaluation by consumers, avoiding unnecessary copies
        when the full state is not required.
