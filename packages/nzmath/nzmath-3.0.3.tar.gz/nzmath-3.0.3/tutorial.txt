NZMATH Tutorial (version 3.0.3 or later)
==========================================

--------------
1. What is it?
--------------

NZMATH is a Python calculator on number theory.  The purpose of the
NZMATH system is to provide mathematical, especially number-theoretic
computational power to you.  It is written in Python scripting
language in order to enhance quickly with users' experiences.

--------
2. Usage
--------

2.1. Before You Start
=====================

Detailed `tutorial on installing packages`_ will help you to install
NZMATH on your machine.

.. _`tutorial on installing packages`: https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/installing-packages/

Usually, you must have appropriate write permission to your machine.

2.1.1. Installation of Python
-----------------------------

NZMATH requires Python version 3.9 or later.  If you do not have Python
installed on your machine, please install it.  The Python language
is a very high level language.  It is downloadable from the website_.
There are also some documents there.

.. _website: https://www.python.org/

Ensure you can run Python from the command line::

    % python --version

(We use '%' for a command line prompt on UNIX/macOS.  On Windows, it
may be 'C:\>' or something.  Sometimes, you may need to be a privileged
user and the prompt may change to # or so on, but we don't care.)

2.1.1.1. Note about Python 2
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

NZMATH is ready for Python 3 now, and will not support for Python 2.
For Python 2, you can install a former version NZMATH-1.2.0 for example.

2.1.2. Installation of NZMATH
-----------------------------

2.1.2.1. Install from PyPI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Next, ensure you can run pip from the command line::

    % python -m pip --version

Then, you can use pip installation from command line.  Now, ensure pip
itself, setuptools and wheel are up to date::

    % python -m pip install -U pip setuptools wheel

Finally, you can now install NZMATH from PyPI by::

    % python -m pip install -U nzmath

The easiest way to get the newest NZMATH!

2.1.2.2. Install from Local Archives
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you cannot install NZMATH directly from PyPI by some reason, you may
install it from local archives.  For that, you need to obtain source
distribution (sdist) and/or built distribution (wheel)::

    nzmath-x.y.z.tar.gz
    nzmath-x.y.z-py3-none-any.whl

in advance, where x, y, z are non-negative integers meaning version
numbers of NZMATH.  You can get them at SourceForge_.

.. _SourceForge: https://sourceforge.net/projects/nzmath/files/nzmath/

You can also find them at PyPI_.

.. _PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/nzmath/

Assume that nzmath-x.y.z.tar.gz and nzmath-x.y.z-py3-none-any.whl are
obtained and put in a local folder say /tmp/dist for example.  Then, by
any of the three methods below, you can install NZMATH-x.y.z::

    % python -m pip install -U --no-index -f /tmp/dist/ nzmath

or::

    % python -m pip install -U /tmp/dist/nzmath-x.y.z.tar.gz

or::

    % python -m pip install -U /tmp/dist/nzmath-x.y.z-py3-none-any.whl

2.1.2.3. Config Setting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The module tries to load the user's config file named nzmathconf.py, a
Python script from nzmath.config. Users can set the constants like
HAVE_MPMATH, which will override the default settings. These constants,
except assumption ones, are automatically set, unless constants
accompanying the check functions are false.  See nzmathconf.py.example_
in detail.

.. _nzmathconf.py.example: nzmathconf.py.example


2.1.3. Installation of IPython
------------------------------

(Optional, but recommended)

IPython is an enhanced interactive Python shell.  If you do not have
it installed on your system, it is recommended to install it now.

You can get IPython with pip::

    % python -m pip install -U ipython

2.1.4. Installation of mpmath
-----------------------------

(Optional, but recommended)

mpmath is a multiple precision floating point arithmetic package for
Python.  Some modules in NZMATH essentially depend on the availability
of mpmath, and some other modules can be more powerful with mpmath.

You can get mpmath with pip::

    % python -m pip install -U mpmath

2.2. Quick Start
================

2.2.1. User Interfaces
----------------------

NZMATH does not have own interpreter nor graphical interface.  Users
have to use with the raw Python interpreter (or possibly IPython).
Though the interpreters are designed well, of course, they are not
specialized for mathematical computation.  Please be patient about it.

2.2.2. Sample Session
---------------------

Start your Python interpreter. ::

    % python
    Python 3.9.16 (...........................)[..........] on ......
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>>

Here, '>>>' is a Python prompt.  You are in the Python interpreter
until you will type 'exit()'.  Then, type ::

    >>> from nzmath import *
    >>>

The whole NZMATH stuff is imported. ::

    >>> r = rational.Rational(113, 355)
    >>> print(r)
    113/355
    >>>
    ....

The session continues until you will stop.

2.2.3. Readline
---------------

(Optional)

As you see, class names of NZMATH objects may be boringly long to
type.  You can use completion feature; if you are using ipython it is
presented by default, or if you use default Python you might be able
to configure it to use readline.  Unfortunately, sometimes Python is
built WITHOUT readline module for some license issue.  So, the
following is for those who are lucky to have readline enabled Python.

Save the following content in your file, pythonrc.py, for example:

try:
    import readline
except ImportError:
    print("Module readline not available.")
else:
    import rlcompleter
    readline.parse_and_bind("tab: complete")

Then, set environment variable PYTHONSTARTUP pointing to the file.

(Please read Python Library Reference of readline and rlcompleter
modules for more detailed explanation.)

-------------------------
3. How to Write a Program
-------------------------

Writing everything at the interpreter prompt is a dull work.  Instead
of it, you can make a program file.

The name of the file must end with '.py'; for example, 'sample.py'.

The contents of the file must be a valid Python program.  And, you may
want to import some NZMATH modules at the start of the file.

See the Python documents for detailed Python syntax or built-in data
types and functions.  NZMATH data types are explained below.

To invoke your program (sample.py, say), simply type ::

    % python sample.py

-------------
4. Data types
-------------

Python is an object-oriented programming language, and user can create
a new data type as class.  The data types provided by NZMATH are also
classes, which have a lot of methods including overloaded operators.

4.1. Numbers
============

4.1.1. Integer
--------------

There is an integer data type int (arbitrary precision) in Python.
NZMATH has Integer (nzmath.rational.Integer) to give a rational result
for division instead of a float. ::

    >>> rational.Integer(3) / 4
    Rational(3, 4)
    >>> 3 / 4
    0.75

Python's int behaves just like C's int type by double slash operator,
i.e. floor division. ::

    >>> 3 // 4
    0
    >>> 8 // 5
    1

4.1.2. Rational
---------------

NZMATH provides Rational (nzmath.rational.Rational) class representing
a rational number, as already appeared in the previous example.

4.1.3. Algebraic number
-----------------------

In NZMATH, algfield module provides algebraic numbers.

4.1.4. floating point number
----------------------------

Python has float data type for it.  The mpmath also provides it.

4.2. Algebraic types
====================

4.2.1. Polynomials
------------------

There are several polynomial classes.  New users should use poly
sub-package. ::

    >>> poly.uniutil.polynomial({0:-1,100:1}, rational.theIntegerRing)
    IntegerPolynomial([(0, -1), (100, 1)], IntegerRing())

poly.uniutil.polynomial is the factory function for univariate
polynomials.

4.2.2. Matrices
---------------

There are several matrix classes.  matrix module provides them.

4.3. Algebraic structures
=========================

4.3.1. Rings
------------

Integers are in the integer ring, a polynomial in a certain polynomial
ring, etc....  They are obtained from elements of them by getRing
method.  For example, rational.Integer(1).getRing() returns a
rational.IntegerRing object.

This is a convention in NZMATH and does not apply to the object
provided by Python itself such as int...

4.3.2. Fields
-------------

Fields are a part of rings (see Rings).

There are some fields: the field of rational numbers, real numbers,
and complex numbers are defined.  Finite fields are provided through
finitefield module.

4.3.3. Groups
-------------

There are some groups in NZMATH: for example, class group of
imaginary quadratic fields in quad module, or rational point of
elliptic curves over finite fields in elliptic module.

We are not providing general frameworks for them, though.

----------------
5. Other Modules
----------------

There are other modules, such as bigrandom, factor, prime, etc.
Please read the manual for those modules.
