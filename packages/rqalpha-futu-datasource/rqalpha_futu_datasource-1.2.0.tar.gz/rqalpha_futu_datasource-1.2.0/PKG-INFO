              "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
              submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the

              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
        
              To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
              boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
              replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
              the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
              comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
              file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
              same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
              identification within third-party archives.

# rqalpha-futu-datasource

由于RQAlpha回测框架提供的数据，需要付费(还挺贵)，并且只有A股的数据。
因此为RQAlpha框架提供自定义的Futu(富途)数据源，同时支持A股、港股、美股数据。用于基于rqalpha框架的股票回测。

## 用法

### 本地开发

推荐使用`uv`工具管理项目依赖。执行以下命令安装项目依赖：

```bash
make sync
```

后续即可做开发和测试。

### 安装

- `pip install rqalpha-futu-datasource`

### 下载富途原始数据到本地

- 启动本地 OpenD(默认 `127.0.0.1:11111`)
- 运行下载脚本，将数据保存为 CSV：
  - `python -m rqalpha_futu_datasource.download --data-dir data --codes 000001.XSHE,600000.XSHG,00700.XHKG,US.AAPL --periods 1m,3m,5m,1d,1w --start 2024-01-01 --end 2024-12-31`
  - 或使用代码文件：`python -m rqalpha_futu_datasource.download --data-dir data --code-file ./codes.txt`
- 目录结构：`data/<MARKET>/<SYMBOL>/<period>.csv`，例如：`data/SZ/000001/1d.csv`
- 可通过环境变量指定目录：`set FUTU_DATA_DIR=...`（Windows）

> 注意：
>
> - 下载富途原始数据时，也可以指定富途OpenD的地址和端口号，如"--host 192.168.0.2 --port 22222"
> - 为了使用方便，`--codes`的格式同时支持富途的股票代码格式（如 `SZ.000001`、`SH.600000`、`HK.00700`、`US.AAPL`）与 `RQAlpha` 的股票代码格式（如 `000001.XSHE`、`600000.XSHG`、`00700.XHKG`、`AAPL.XNAS`）。
> - 同时，`--code-file`参数也支持同时包含这两种格式的股票代码，每个股票代码占一行。
> - 但回测代码里面的股票代码格式，必须是 `RQAlpha` 格式（如 `000001.XSHE`、`600000.XSHG`、`00700.XHKG`、`AAPL.XNAS`）。

### 在 RQAlpha 中启用 Futu 数据源

通过扩展模块替换默认DataSource。参考：[test_rqalpha.py](tests/test_rqalpha.py), [mod_futu_ds.py](src/rqalpha_futu_datasource/mod_futu_ds.py)

#### 1. 基础配置

```python
from rqalpha import run_func


def test_run_with_futu_datasource():
    config = {
        "base": {
            "start_date": "2024-11-01",
            "end_date": "2024-11-06",
            "accounts": {"stock": 100000},
            "frequency": "1m",
            "data_bundle_path": os.path.abspath("tests/data"),
        },
        "extra": {
            "log_level": "info",
        },
        "mod": {
            "futu_ds": {
                "enabled": True,
                "lib": "rqalpha_futu_datasource.mod_futu_ds",
            }
        },
    }
    run_func(init=init, handle_bar=handle_bar, config=config)
```

#### 2. 配置港股每手（Board Lot）

为避免网络依赖，港股每手数量支持以本地方式配置。如果不配置港股每手映射表，默认每手为100。支持以下两种方式（优先使用内存字典）：

- **通过 CSV 文件路径**：配置 `hk_lot_map_path`。CSV 需包含 `code` 与 `lot_size`（或 `lot`/`board_lot`）列。
- **通过内存字典**：配置 `hk_lot_map`。

配置示例：

```python
config = {
    "mod": {
        "futu_ds": {
            "enabled": True,
            "lib": "rqalpha_futu_datasource.mod_futu_ds",
            # 方式一：指定 CSV 文件路径
            "hk_lot_map_path": os.path.abspath("tests/data/hk_lot_map.csv"),
            # 方式二：直接传入字典 (优先级更高)
            "hk_lot_map": {"00700": 200, "00005": 500},
        }
    },
}
```

CSV 文件示例：

```csv
code,lot_size
00700,200
00005,500
```

#### 3. 配置交易日历范围（Markets）

`rqalpha-futu-datasource` 需要知道在哪个市场中查找交易日历数据。这可以通过 `rqalpha` 的 `base` 配置中的 `market` 参数来确定：

```python
config = {
    "base": {
        "market": "cn",  # 可选值: "cn" (默认), "hk", "us"
        # ... 其他 base 配置
    },
    "mod": {
        "futu_ds": {
            "enabled": True,
            # ... 其他配置
        }
    }
}
```

- `cn`: 对应 A 股市场（包含 SH 和 SZ）。
- `hk`: 对应港股市场（HK）。
- `us`: 对应美股市场（US）。

如果未配置 `base.market`，默认使用 `cn`。

### 指定富途数据存储目录有三种方式

1. 在RQAlpha的模块配置中指定：

   ```python
   config = {
      "mod": {
            "futu_ds": {
                "enabled": True,
                "lib": "rqalpha_futu_datasource.mod_futu_ds",
                "futu_data_dir": "path/to/futu/data",
            }
        },
   }
   ```

2. 在RQAlpha base配置中指定：

   ```python
   config = {
       "base": {
           "data_bundle_path": "path/to/futu/data",
       },
   }
   ```

3. 在环境变量中指定：

   ```bash
   export FUTU_DATA_DIR=path/to/futu/data
   ```

优先级按此顺序：模块配置 > base配置 > 环境变量。

### 限制及说明

- RQAlpha与富途股票代码之间的对应关系是：
  - A股：`000001.XSHE` -> `SZ.000001` (深圳交易所)
  - A股：`603728.XSHG` -> `SH.603728` (上海交易所)
  - 港股：`00700.XHKG` -> `HK.00700`  (香港交易所)
  - 美股：`AAPL.XNAS` -> `US.AAPL`  (纳斯达克交易所)
  - 美股：`TSM.XNYS` -> `US.TSM`  (纽约交易所)
- 限制：
  - 仅支持股票数据，不支持期货、期权等其他品种。
  - 原始从富途下载的数据就只能是股票前复权数据。不支持其他复权方式。
  - 数据不能增量更新，有新数据需求只能重新下载全量数据(富途的OpenD进程会本地缓存数据，所以不用太担心此问题)。
  - 回测频率支持周期 `1m`、`1d`(RQAlpha框架限制)，在handle_bar回调函数中，可以查询的历史数据周期为:`1m`, `3m`, `5m`, `1d`, `1w`(RQAlpha框架限制，无法支持到月级别)。
