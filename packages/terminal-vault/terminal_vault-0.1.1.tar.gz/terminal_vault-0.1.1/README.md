# Terminal Note Vault

A local, offline password security toolkit and note vault.

## Security Toolkit Demo (Single Script)

A standalone educational demo for secure password management.

### Features
- **Secure Vault**: AES-128 (Fernet) encryption with PBKDF2 key derivation.
- **Password Policy**: Enforces min 8 chars, alphanumeric (letters + numbers).
- **Input Masking**: Asterisks (`******`) on Windows, hidden input on others.
- **Lockout Manager**: Exponential backoff for failed attempts.
- **Batch Mode**: Analyze CSV files for password strength.
- **Entropy Estimation**: Log2-based strength estimation.

### Installation
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage
Run the script directly:

```bash
python src/terminal_vault/security_toolkit.py <command> [args]
```

**Commands:**
- `init`: Initialize a new vault and set a master password.
- `add <name>`: Add a new secret.
- `get <name>`: Retrieve a secret.
- `check`: Check a password against the policy.
- `batch <file.csv>`: Batch check passwords from a CSV file.
- `reset-lockout`: Reset failed attempt counters.

### Security Boundaries (IMPORTANT)
> [!WARNING]
> **Educational Demo Only**

This toolkit is designed for educational purposes to demonstrate security concepts.
- **Scope**: Protects against casual local access and throttled brute-force attacks.
- **Limitations**:
    - **No Host Protection**: Does not protect against malware, keyloggers, or root access.
    - **No Memory Protection**: Secrets may exist in memory.
    - **No Cloud/Sync**: Strictly local storage.
    - **No Hardware Security**: Does not use TPM or Secure Enclave.
    - **Recovery**: If you lose your Master Password and Recovery Token, data is lost.
