  # CodeQL Advanced Setup - REQUIRES MANUAL CONFIGURATION
  #
  # IMPORTANT: This job will fail if GitHub's "CodeQL default setup" is enabled.
  # Before this workflow can run successfully, you MUST disable the default setup:
  #
  # 1. Go to: Settings → Advanced Security (in the Security section of the sidebar)
  # 2. Look for: "CodeQL analysis" under the Code Security area
  # 3. Click: Configuration option or three dots menu (⋯)
  # 4. Select: "Disable CodeQL default setup"
  #
  # GitHub does not allow both default and advanced configurations simultaneously.
  # See .github/CODEQL_SETUP.md for detailed instructions and troubleshooting.
  #
  # Why Advanced Setup?
  # - Extended security queries (security-and-quality suite)
  # - Custom language configurations with proper build steps
  # - Integration with our CI/CD pipeline
  # - Consistent scanning across all branches
