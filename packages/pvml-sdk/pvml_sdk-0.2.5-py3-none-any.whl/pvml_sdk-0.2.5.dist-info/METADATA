# PVML SDK

pvml-sdk — the official SDK for interacting with PVML virtual-database and privacy infrastructure.  

> PVML: “Your Database, Virtualized for AI.” Live, scoped, secure access to internal databases. AI ready all the time.

## What is PVML SDK

PVML SDK enables your applications to connect to your existing databases through PVML, turning them into “virtual databases” that:

- Provide real-time data access — no data duplication or migration needed.  
- Enforce fine-grained permissions and privacy protections (e.g. output-level protection via differential privacy) on every query.  
- Allow access via SQL, BI tools, AI agents or SDK interfaces — so you can integrate with whatever stack you use (Python, Go, TS, or others).  

## Install

```bash
pip install pvml-sdk
