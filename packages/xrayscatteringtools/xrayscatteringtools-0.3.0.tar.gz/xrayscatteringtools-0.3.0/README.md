# X-Ray Scattering Tools

`xrayscatteringtools` is a Python library designed for advanced X-ray scattering data analysis. It provides tools for data processing, visualization, calibration, and theoretical modeling. Specifically, it works alongside the [CXI-Template](https://github.com/Weber-Group/CXI-Template) repository for analyzing data from the Linac Coherent Light Source's Coherent X-ray Imaging hutch.

## Features

- **Data I/O**: Read and write various data formats, including `.xyz` and `.mol` files, and handle experimental data stored in HDF5.
- **Visualization**: Generate plots for detector data.
- **Calibration**: Perform geometry calibration and create masks for X-ray scattering experiments.
- **Theoretical Modeling**: Compute scattering patterns using theoretical models and atomic data.
- **Utilities**: A collection of helper functions for unit conversions, azimuthal binning, and more.
