               on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
               subsequently incorporated within the Work.
         
            2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
               this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
               worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
               copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
               publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
               Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
         
            3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
               this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
               worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
               (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
               use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
               where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
               by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
               Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
               with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
               institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
               cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
               or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
               or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
               granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
               as of the date such litigation is filed.
         
            4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
               Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
               modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
               meet the following conditions:
         
               (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                   Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
         
               (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                   stating that You changed the files; and
         
               (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                   that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                   attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                   excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                   the Derivative Works; and
         
               (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                   distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                   include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                   within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                   pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                   of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                   as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                   documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                   within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                   wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                   of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                   do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                   notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                   or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                   that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                   as modifying the License.
         
               You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
               may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
               for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
               for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
               reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
               the conditions stated in this License.
         
            5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
               any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
               by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
               this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
               Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
               the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
               with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
         
            6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
               names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
               except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
               origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
         
            7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
               agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
               Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
               WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
               implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
               of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
               PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
               appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
               risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
         
            8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
               whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
               unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
               negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
               liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
               incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
               result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
               Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
               work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
               other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
               has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
         
            9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
               the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
               and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
               or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
               License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
               on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
               of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
               defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
               incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
               of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
         
            END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
         
            APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

# TestArchiver

TestArchiver is a tool for archiving your test results to a SQL database.

And [Epimetheus](https://github.com/salabs/Epimetheus) is the tool for browsing the results you archived.

## Testing framework support

| Framework       | Status                      | Fixture test status | Parser option |
| --------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------- |
| Robot Framework | [Supported](robot_tests/)   | Done                | robot         |
| Mocha           | [Supported](mocha_tests/)   | Done                | mocha-junit   |
| pytest          | [Supported](pytest/)        | Done                | pytest-junit  |
| PHPUnit         | [Supported](phpunit_tests/) | Done                | php-junit     |
| JUnit           | Experimental                | Missing             | junit         |
| xUnit           | Experimental                | Missing             | xunit         |
| MSTest          | Experimental                | Missing             | mstest        |


Experimental status here means that there is a parser that can take in e.g. generic JUnit formatted output but there is no specific test set or any extensive testing or active development for the parser.

Contributions for output parsers or listeners for different testing frameworks are appreciated. Contributing simply a fixture test set (that can be used to generate output files for developing a specific parser) is extremely helpful for any new framework.

## Installation
`sudo -H python3 -m pip install testarchiver`

## Supported databases

### SQLite

[SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org) default database for the archiver and is mainly useful for testing and demo purposes. Sqlite3 driver is part of the python standard library so there are no additional dependencies for trying out the archiver.

### PostgreSQL

[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) is the currently supported database for real projects. For example [Epimetheus](https://github.com/salabs/Epimetheus) service uses a PosrgreSQL database. For accessing PostgreSQL databases the script uses psycopg2 module: `pip install psycopg2-binary` (comes with pip install)

## Basic usage

The output files from different testing frameworks can be parsed into a database using `test_archiver/output_parser.py` script.

```
testarchiver --database test_archive.db output.xml
```

Assuming that `output.xml` is a output file generated by Robot Framework (the default parser option), this will create a SQLite database file named `test_archive.db` that contains the results.

The archiver script can also be invoked from the module:
```
python3 -m test_archiver.output_parser --database test_archive.db output.xml
```

For list of other options: `testarchiver --help`
```
positional arguments:
  output_files          list of test output files to parse in to the test
                        archive

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --version, -v         show program's version number and exit
  --config CONFIG_FILE  Path to JSON config file containing database
                        credentials and other configurations. Options given on
                        command line will override options set in a config
                        file.
  --format {robot,robotframework,xunit,junit,mocha-junit,pytest-junit,mstest,php-junit}
                        output format (default: robotframework)
  --repository REPOSITORY
                        The repository of the test cases. Used to
                        differentiate between test with same name in different
                        projects.
  --team TEAM           Team name for the test series
  --series SERIES       Name of the test series (and optionally build number
                        'SERIES_NAME#BUILD_NUM' or build id
                        'SERIES_NAME#BUILD_ID')
  --metadata NAME:VALUE
                        Adds given metadata to the test run. Expected format:
                        'NAME:VALUE'

Database connection:
  --dbengine DB_ENGINE  Database engine, postgresql or sqlite (default)
  --database DATABASE   database name
  --host HOST           database host name
  --user USER           database user
  --pw PASSWORD, --password PASSWORD
                        database password
  --port PORT           database port (default: 5432)
  --dont-require-ssl    Disable the default behavior to require ssl from the
                        target database.

Schema updates:
  --allow-minor-schema-updates
                        Allow TestArchiver to perform MINOR (backwards
                        compatible) schema updates the test archive
  --allow-major-schema-updates
                        Allow TestArchiver to perform MAJOR (backwards
                        incompatible) schema updates the test archive

Clean history:
  If any of the following options are used the archiver will delete the oldest
  result data. What data is kept can be controlled with these --keep-X options
  that can also be mixed. If deletion targets are not specified with --clean-X
  options all test run data is cleaned. --keep-X options should be used when
  using --clean-X options otherwise entire history is cleared.

  --keep-builds KEEP_BUILDS
                        Delete old result data but keep the data for at least
                        given number of builds in each series.
  --keep-months KEEP_MONTHS
                        Delete old result data but keep data that was archived
                        more recently than given number of months ago
  --keep-after KEEP_AFTER
                        Delete old result data but keep data that was archived
                        more recently than given date in ISO 8601 format
                        yyyy-mm-dd.
  --clean-team CLEAN_TEAM
                        Delete results only archived under given team name. Use

                        Specify how many characters of the log message that is
                        archived. full: archives the complete log. positive
                        integers: archives number of characters from the
                        beginning. negative integers: archives number of
                        characters from the end.

Adjust timestamps:
  --time-adjust-secs TIME_ADJUST_SECS
                        Adjust time in timestamps by given seconds. This can
                        be used to change time to utc before writing the
                        results to database, especially if the test system
                        uses local time, such as robot framework. For example
                        if test were run in Finland (GMT+3) in summer (+1hr),
                        calculate total hours by minutes and seconds and
                        invert to adjust in correct direction, i.e.
                        -(3+1)*60*60, so --time-adjust-secs -14400. This
                        option is useful if you are archiving in a different
                        location to where tests are run.If you are running
                        tests and archiving in same timezone, time-adjust-
                        with-system-timezone may be a better option. This
                        option may be used in conjunction with --time-adjust-
                        with-system-timezone if desired.
  --time-adjust-with-system-timezone
                        Adjust the time in timestamps by the system timezone
                        (including daylight savings adjust). If you are
                        archiving tests in the same timezone as you are
                        running tests, setting this option will ensure time
                        written to the database is in UTC/GMT time. This
                        assumes that if multiple computers are used that their
                        timezone and daylight savings settings are identical.
                        Take care also that you do not run tests just before a
                        daylight savings time adjust and archive just after,
                        as times will be out by one hour. This could easily
                        happen if long running tests cross a timezone adjust
                        boundary. This option may be used in conjunction with
                        --time-adjust-secs.

ChangeEngine:
  --change-engine-url CHANGE_ENGINE_URL
                        Starts a listener that feeds results to ChangeEngine
  --execution-context EXECUTION_CONTEXT
                        To separate data from different build pipelines for
                        ChangeEngine prioritization. Example if same changes
                        or tests may be used to verify app in Android and iOS
                        platforms, then it would be good to separate the
                        result from different builds pipelines/platforms. The
                        ChangeEngine prioritization might not give correct
                        result if different results from different platforms
                        are mixed together.
  --changes CHANGES     Json file which contains information from the changed
                        files for each repo. The file should be formatted like
                        this: { "context": "The execution context, same as
                        --execution-context and command line will override
                        this setting.", "changes": [ { "name": "string
                        representing the changed item, for example file path",
                        "repository": "Repository (optional), for separating
                        between changed items with identical names.",
                        "item_type": "Separating items (optional) and for
                        filtering subsets when prioritising", "subtype":
                        "(optional, for separating items for filtering subsets
                        when prioritising" } ] }
  --execution-id EXECUTION_ID
                        Identifier or version of the tested application for
                        given execution-context. Stored in ChangeEngine and
                        returned by "last_update" query.
```

## Data model

[Schema and data model](https://github.com/salabs/TestArchiver/tree/master/test_archiver/schemas) (NOTICE: this points to latest version)

The schema is versioned and new versions of TestArchiver might require schema updates.
Mismatches with testarchiver version and database schema will cause parsing to fail.
TestArchiver can perform the required schema updates if `--allow-minor-schema-updates` or `--allow-major-schema-updates` flags are used.
Some updates require only minor updates that should be backwards compatible for tools reading the archived data.
Other updates are major and change the schema in backwards incompatible way.

Schema initialisation, schema updates and history cleaning can be run without parsing results using `testarchive_schematool` or the module directly `python3 -m test_archiver.database`.

## Useful metadata

There are meta data that are useful to add with the results. Some testing frameworks allow adding metadata to your test results and for those frameworks (e.g. Robot Framework) it is recommended to add that metadata already to the tests so the same information is also available in the results. Additional metadata can be added when parsing the results using the `--metadata` option. Metadata given during the parsing is linked to the top level test suite.

`--metadata NAME:VALUE`

## Test series and teams

In the data model, each test result file is represented as single test run. These test runs are linked and organized into builds in in different result series. Depending on the situation the series can be e.g. CI build jobs or different branches. By default if no series is specified the results are linked to a default series with autoincrementing build numbers. Different test runs (from different testing frameworks or parallel executions) that belong together can be organized into the same build. Different test series are additionally organized by team. Series name and build number/id are separated by `#`.

Some examples using the `--series` and `--team` options of `testarchiver`

-   `--series ${JENKINS_JOB_NAME}#${BUILD_NUMBER}`
-   `--series "UI tests"#<commit hash>`
-   `--series ${CURRENT_BRANCH}#${BUILD_ID} --team Team-A`
-   `--series manually_run`

Each build will have a build number in the series. If the build number is specified then that number is used. If the build number/id is omitted then the build number will be checked from the previous build in that series and incremented. If the build number/id is not a number it is considered a build identifier string. If that id is new to the series the build number is incremented just as if it no build number was specified. If the same build id is found in the same test series then the results are added under that same previously archived build.

If the tests are executed in a CI environment the build number/id is an excellent way to link the archived results to the actual builds.

The series can also be indicated using metadata. Any metadata with name prefixed with `series` are interpreted as series information. This is especially useful when using listeners. For example when using Robot Framework metadata `--metadata team:A-Team --metadata series:JENKINS_JOB_NAME#BUILD_NUMBER`

## Timestamp adjustment

Some test frameworks use local time in their timestamps. For archiving into databases this can be problematic if tests
are viewed and or run in different timezones. To address this two ways to adjust the time back to GMT/UTC are provided.

The first allows the user to apply an adjustment of a fixed time in seconds of their choosing. This is useful for cases
where tests were already run and the place/timezone where they were run are known. This option is useful if you are
archiving in a different location to where tests are  run. The time value provided as an option is added to the
timestamp. Care must be taken with places where summer time is different (usually +1hr).

For example if test were run in Finland (GMT+2), plus 1 hour in summer, calculate total hours by minutes and seconds
and invert to adjust in correct direction, i.e. -(2+1)*60*60, so --time-adjust-secs -10800 in summer time,
and -7200 otherwise.

The second provides for automated adjustment based on the system timezone and/or daylight savings if it applies. This
is useful if the tests and archiving are performed in the same place and time.
This assumes that if multiple computers are used that their timezone and daylight savings settings are identical.
Care must also be taken that tests are not run just before a daylight savings time adjust and archived just after
as times will be out by one hour. This could easily happen if long running tests cross a timezone adjust boundary.
This can be set using --time-adjust-with-system-timezone.

The ArchiverRobotListener allows for the second option if its adjust_with_system_timezone argument is set to True.

To ensure any of the optional adjustments are traceable, two meta data values are added to the suites' test run.
If time-adjust-secs is set to a value, time_adjust_secs with that value is written to the suite_metadata table.
If `--time-adjust-with-system-timezone` option is included, then the addition of the time-adjust-secs and the
system timezone is written to the suite_metadata tables as time_adjust_secs_total.

e.g with command line

`output_parser.py --time-adjust-secs -3600 --time-adjust-with-system-timezone ...`

the following values would be added to suite_metadata table for (GMT+2)

 - time_adjust_secs with value -3600
 - time_adjust_secs_total with -10800.

This example is mimicking adding daylight savings (1hr = 3600 secs) onto
a system offset secs of 7200 (GMT+2). i.e. if the computer being used had the 'daylight savings' setting
of and you want to manually add it during archiving.

## Cleaning old data
Since version 3.0.0 there is support for cleaning/deleting oldest archived data. These options allow limiting the growth of the history with various options that control what types of data are cleaned and how long history is kept.
Different --keep-X and --clean-X options can be mixed to select what data is kept after cleaning.
In most cases --keep-X options are used when ever --clean-X options are used.

While history cleaning can be run with every results parsing update it is recomended to run cleaning operations separately.
Cleaning history can be run without parsing results using `testarchive_schematool` or the module directly `python3 -m test_archiver.database`.

Some examples
- `python3 -m test_archiver.database --keep-months 6`
  Will delete all results older than 6 months
- `python3 -m test_archiver.database --keep-months 6 --clean-logs --clean-keyword-stats`
  Only deletes logs and keywords statistics older than 6 months. Test results are not effected
- `python3 -m test_archiver.database --keep-builds 10 --keep-months 6`
  Will delete all results older than 6 months but still keeping at least 10 last builds of each series
- `python3 -m test_archiver.database --lean-team Team-A`
  Will delete all results archived under Team-A
- `python3 -m test_archiver.database --clean-logs`
  Will delete all log log messages
