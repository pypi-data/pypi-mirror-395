- Update with new quotes and examples

```

---

## Workflow: Outline to Draft

**Create:** `projects/<project>/drafts/persona-segmentation.md`

**Step 1: YAML frontmatter + outline**
- List personas to create (typically 2-4)
- Map sources (interviews, research, sales data)
- Set status: `outline`

**Step 2: Conduct customer interviews**
- Interview 5-10 people per persona
- Ask about goals, challenges, day-to-day
- Capture quotes and specific examples
- Record decision criteria and objections

**Step 3: Gather additional research**
- Sales call notes and win/loss data
- Support tickets and common questions
- Product usage data
- Market research on roles

**Step 4: Create persona profiles**
- Start with most important persona (usually primary user or buyer)
- Use real quotes and examples
- Be specific, avoid generic statements
- Focus on what's different between personas

**Step 5: Define messaging and content strategy**
- For each persona, clarify:
  - What message resonates
  - What proof they need
  - What content they consume
  - How to reach them

**Step 6: Validate with teams**
- Review with sales (does this match who they talk to?)
- Review with marketing (can they create content for this?)
- Review with product (does this align with roadmap?)
- Adjust based on feedback

**Step 7: Distribute and train**
- Share with teams
- Create quick reference cards
- Train on how to use personas
- Integrate into processes (content planning, sales calls, etc.)

---

## Research Workflow

**Step 1: Identify Personas to Create (30 min)**

Ask user:
- "Who are the key people involved in buying/using your product?"
- "Who makes the final decision?"
- "Who evaluates and recommends?"
- "Who uses it day-to-day?"

Typically results in 2-4 personas:
- Primary user
- Primary buyer
- Influencer/champion (if different)

**Step 2: Schedule Customer Interviews (1-2 weeks)**

Ask user to help schedule:
- 5-10 customers per persona
- Mix of recent wins and long-time customers
- Include prospects if possible
- 30-45 min interviews

**Interview questions:**
- Goals: What are you trying to accomplish?
- Challenges: What gets in the way?
- Day-to-day: Walk me through a typical day
- Tools: What do you use? What do you like/dislike?
- Decision: How did you evaluate options? What criteria mattered?
- Content: How do you learn about new tools?

**Step 3: Analyze Sales and Support Data (2-3 hours)**

```bash
# Search for existing customer insights
kurt content search "interview"
kurt content search "customer"
kurt content search "feedback"
```

Ask user for:
- Win/loss analysis (why deals were won/lost)
- Sales call notes (common objections, questions)
- Support tickets (what users struggle with)

**Step 4: Research Role Context (1-2 hours)**

```bash
# Research the role
kurt research query "[job title] typical responsibilities and priorities"
kurt research query "[job title] common challenges in [industry]"

# Check community discussions
kurt research search --source reddit --query "[job title] daily work"
kurt research search --source hackernews --query "[job title] tools and workflow"
```

**Step 5: Draft Personas (3-4 hours)**

For each persona:
- Synthesize interview findings
- Include real quotes (anonymized)
- Be specific about their world
- Focus on what makes them unique
- Define implications for messaging and content

---

## Common Persona Patterns

**User Personas (Day-to-day product users):**
- Care about: Ease of use, productivity, capabilities
- Influenced by: Hands-on trial, documentation, peer recommendations
- Content: Tutorials, technical blog posts, docs

**Buyer Personas (Make purchase decision):**
- Care about: Business value, ROI, risk
- Influenced by: Case studies, peer references, analyst reports
- Content: Executive briefings, ROI calculators, business cases

**Champion Personas (Internal advocates):**
- Care about: Looking good, solving team problems
- Influenced by: Quick wins, ease of adoption
- Content: Proof points they can present internally

---

## Success Factors

**Good personas:**
- Research-based (not assumptions)
- Specific (concrete details, real quotes)
- Actionable (guide messaging and content decisions)
- Focused (2-4 personas, not 10)
- Living documents (updated regularly)

**Red flags:**
- ❌ Generic/stereotypical (made up without research)
- ❌ Too many personas (dilutes focus)
- ❌ Never used (created but ignored)
- ❌ All the same (no meaningful differences)
- ❌ Static (never updated with new insights)
