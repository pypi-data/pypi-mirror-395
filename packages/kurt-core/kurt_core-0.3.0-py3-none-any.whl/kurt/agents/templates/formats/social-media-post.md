## Research Requirements

**Types of information needed for social posts:**

1. **Content/message** - What you're sharing
   - Blog post, product update, announcement, insight to share

2. **Trending topics** - What's relevant now
   - Industry news, current events, trending hashtags

3. **Audience insights** - What resonates
   - Past post performance data, audience research, engagement patterns

**Note**: Use kurt CLI research commands for external research. See @find-sources rule for discovery methods and @add-source rule for ingestion.

## Source Requirements

**Before writing, gather these sources (documented in plan.md):**

**Core message/content:**
- Content to promote (blog post, product update, etc.)
- Key message or topic

**Context/validation:**
- Related blog posts
- Related documentation

**Note**: Use kurt CLI to discover and fetch sources. See rule files (@find-sources, @add-source) for methods. All sources should be documented in plan.md "Sources of Ground Truth" section.

**If insufficient sources: Ask user for the content to promote, key message, or topic to discuss**

## Customizing This Template (One-Time Setup)

**When to customize:** First time writing social posts for this company

**Goal:** Fill in "[CUSTOMIZATION NEEDED]" section with company's social media style

### Step 1: Get Company's Social Posts

**Ask user for examples:**
"I need 5-10 recent social media posts from [company] to understand your style. Can you:
- Provide links to recent posts (LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.)
- Share screenshot or paste text of successful posts
- Give me access to view your social profiles

Which platform do you use most? (I'll focus there for style)"

**Cannot scrape:** Social posts aren't in kurt database - user must provide

### Step 2: Collect 5-10 Examples (Iterative with User)

**Ask user:**
"Please share 5-10 recent posts that represent your style well. Looking for:
- Mix of content types (product updates, insights, shares)
- Posts that performed well (high engagement)
- Recent posts (last 3 months)

You can paste the text or send links."

**Save provided posts:**
- As: `projects/<project>/style-examples/social-posts.md`
- Analyze from these

**Maximum: 10 examples**

### Step 3: Analyze Examples

**For each post, note:**

**Platform:**
- Which platform(s) do they use most?
- Do they adapt message per platform or post same across all?

**Opening hooks:**
- How do they start posts? (question, stat, bold claim, emoji)
- Copy 3-5 actual opening lines

**Content style:**
- Length: short and punchy vs longer form?
- Format: frequent line breaks or paragraph blocks?
- Emoji usage: frequent, occasional, rare?

**Tone:**
- Formality 1-10
- Personal voice ("I") or company voice ("we")?
- Energy: enthusiastic, professional, casual?

**DO/DON'T Examples:**
- Find 2-3 posts showing their best social style
- Write contrasting examples showing what they avoid
- Note why (too sales-y, too casual, wrong platform fit, etc.)

**Hashtags:**
- How many hashtags typical?
- Style: branded (#CompanyName), trending, descriptive?
- Copy hashtag patterns

**Visuals:**
- Always include image or sometimes text-only?
- Type: product screenshots, graphics, photos?

**CTA:**
- How direct? ("Download now" vs "Thoughts?")
- Where placed? (end of post, comments)
- Copy typical CTAs

### Step 4: Update Style Guidelines Section

**Edit this template file and replace "[CUSTOMIZATION NEEDED]":**

```markdown

### Troubleshooting

**Don't have access to company's social posts?**
- Ask user: "I need 5-10 example posts to match your style. Can you share links or paste text?"
- Essential: Cannot create template without seeing actual posts

**Posts vary widely by platform?**
- Note different styles per platform
- Ask user: "Your LinkedIn style is different from Twitter. Should I match both or focus on one?"

**No consistent style yet?**
- Ask user: "You don't have many posts yet. What style do you prefer?
  - Professional/formal (LinkedIn-style)
  - Conversational/casual (Twitter-style)
  - Visual storytelling (Instagram-style)"

**Need the content to promote?**
- Ask user: "What are we promoting in this post? Please provide:
  - Blog post URL or content
  - Product update details
  - Announcement or news to share"
