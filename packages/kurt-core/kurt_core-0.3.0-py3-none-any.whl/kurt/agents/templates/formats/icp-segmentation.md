## Research Requirements

**Types of information needed for ICP segmentation:**

1. **Existing customer analysis** - Who converts and succeeds
   - CRM data, customer list, win/loss analysis
   - Customer case studies

2. **Product fit** - What types of companies need your solution
   - Product capabilities, use cases, technical requirements
   - Product pages

3. **Market research** - Target market characteristics
   - Industry reports, TAM analysis
   - Market segments research

4. **Sales insights** - Who buys and why
   - Win/loss analysis, sales call notes, deal data

5. **Customer success data** - Who gets value and stays
   - Usage data, retention data, expansion data, NPS by segment

**Note**: Use kurt CLI research commands for external research. See @find-sources rule for discovery methods and @add-source rule for ingestion.

---

## Source Requirements

**Before writing, gather these sources (documented in plan.md):**

**Customer data:**
- Customer content, case studies
- Customer examples

**Product context:**
- Product pages, feature pages
- Product capabilities documentation

**Market research:**
- Industry reports, market analysis
- TAM analysis, market segments

**Note**: Use kurt CLI to discover and fetch sources. See rule files (@find-sources, @add-source) for methods. All sources should be documented in plan.md "Sources of Ground Truth" section.bash
# Research market segments
kurt research query "[product category] market segmentation"
kurt research query "[industry] technology adoption"
```

**If insufficient sources: Ask user for CRM data, customer list, or win/loss analysis**

## ICP Evolution

**When to revisit ICP:**
- Quarterly: Review metrics, adjust if needed
- New product launches: May open new segments
- Market changes: Competitive or economic shifts
- Product changes: New capabilities may expand ICP

**Signals ICP needs updating:**
- Win rate changing by segment
- Churn increasing in certain segments
- New successful customer types emerging
- Product positioning evolving

**How to update:**
- Analyze recent wins and losses
- Review customer success data
- Gather sales and CS feedback
- Validate with data before changing

---

## Usage Guidelines

**How sales should use this:**
- Prioritize Tier 1 accounts for outreach
- Qualify inbound leads against criteria
- Tailor messaging to tier
- Escalate exceptions to management

**How marketing should use this:**
- Target Tier 1 for ABM campaigns
- Create content addressing Tier 1 pain points
- Select events where Tier 1 congregates
- Allocate budget by tier priority

**How product should use this:**
- Roadmap prioritization (solve Tier 1 problems)
- Feature trade-offs (optimize for Tier 1)
- Customer research (overweight Tier 1 feedback)
- Pricing and packaging (align with tier economics)

**What NOT to do:**
- Don't ignore inbound Tier 2/3 (could become Tier 1)
- Don't make exceptions without data
- Don't keep pursuing poor-fit accounts
- Don't assume all characteristics required (use scoring)

```

## Workflow: Outline to Draft

**Create:** `projects/<project>/drafts/icp-segmentation.md`

**Step 1: YAML frontmatter + outline**
- List segments to define (Tier 1, 2, 3)
- Map sources (customer data, win/loss, product fit)
- Set status: `outline`

**Step 2: Analyze existing customers**
- Gather customer list with key attributes
- Identify patterns in best customers
- Look for firmographic, technographic, behavioral patterns
- Calculate win rates, deal sizes, retention by segment

**Step 3: Define Tier 1 (ideal) first**
- What characteristics do best customers share?
- What pain points drive their success?
- What buying behaviors are common?
- Create detailed profile

**Step 4: Define Tier 2 and 3**
- How do they differ from Tier 1?
- Why are they still viable (Tier 2) or marginal (Tier 3)?
- What would elevate them to higher tier?

**Step 5: Create qualification criteria**
- Must-have vs nice-to-have attributes
- Quick qualification questions
- Disqualifying factors

**Step 6: Validate with teams**
- Review with sales (does this match reality?)
- Review with CS (do these customers succeed?)
- Review with marketing (can we reach them?)
- Adjust based on feedback

**Step 7: Define go-to-market implications**
- How to prioritize by tier
- Different approaches for each
- Resource allocation

---

## Research Workflow

**Step 1: Gather Customer Data (2-3 hours)**

Ask user for:
- Customer list with firmographics
- Win/loss analysis
- Deal size and sales cycle data
- Retention and expansion data
- Usage or engagement data

Or find existing:
```bash
kurt content search "customer"
kurt content search "case study"
```

**Step 2: Analyze Patterns (3-4 hours)**

**Look for correlations:**
- What company sizes have highest win rate?
- What industries have best retention?
- What tech stacks correlate with fast sales cycles?
- What pain points drive largest deals?

**Quantify findings:**
- [X]% of revenue from [segment]
- [Y]x higher win rate in [segment]
- [Z] day faster sales cycle for [segment]

**Step 3: Define Segments (2-3 hours)**

**Tier 1: Top 20-30% of customers by fit**
- Highest win rate
- Largest deal sizes
- Best retention/expansion
- Fastest sales cycles

**Tier 2: Next 30-40%**
- Good fit but not ideal
- Acceptable economics
- Decent retention

**Tier 3: Remaining viable**
- Marginal fit
- Accept inbound only
- Clear about trade-offs

**Step 4: Create Qualification Criteria (1-2 hours)**

For each tier:
- Must-have attributes
- Nice-to-have attributes
- Disqualifying factors
- Quick qualification questions

**Step 5: Validate and Refine (1-2 hours)**

Test with recent deals:
- Do wins match Tier 1 profile?
- Do losses show disqualifying factors?
- Are there outliers? (understand why)

---

## Common ICP Patterns

**By Company Size:**
- **Enterprise** (1000+ employees): Complex sales, large deals, long cycles
- **Mid-market** (100-1000): Sweet spot for many B2B SaaS
- **SMB** (10-100): High volume, shorter cycles, lower price points
- **Startup** (<10): Often poor economics unless specific strategy

**By Tech Maturity:**
- **Early adopters**: Modern stack, engineering-led, fast decisions
- **Mainstream**: Established processes, longer cycles, references needed
- **Laggards**: Legacy systems, risk-averse, difficult to serve

**By Buying Behavior:**
- **Bottom-up**: End users champion, product-led growth friendly
- **Top-down**: Executive-led, larger deals, more sales involvement
- **Committee**: Multiple stakeholders, longer cycles, consensus required

---

## Success Factors

**Good ICP segmentation:**
- Data-driven (based on actual customer analysis)
- Specific (clear qualification criteria)
- Actionable (teams can use it to prioritize)
- Tiered (not binary yes/no)
- Evolving (updated as business changes)

**Red flags:**
- ❌ Based on wishes not data ("we want enterprise")
- ❌ Too broad ("all tech companies")
- ❌ Static (never updated)
- ❌ Not used (created but ignored)
- ❌ No consequences (no prioritization impact)
