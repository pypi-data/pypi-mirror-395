---

## Part 9: Usage Guidelines

**When to update this document:**

- **Sales enablement:** Train on positioning statement and differentiation
- **Product marketing:** Ground all content in this framework
- **Website copy:** Homepage and product pages should reflect this
- **Campaign planning:** Each campaign emphasizes relevant pillars

**What NOT to do:**
- Don't skip the differentiation (saying what you do isn't enough)
- Don't use feature lists without benefits (so what?)
- Don't ignore competitive alternatives (pretending they don't exist)
- Don't make claims without proof (back it up with evidence)

```
