## Customizing This Template (One-Time Setup)

**When to customize:** First time writing solution page for this company

**Goal:** Fill in "[CUSTOMIZATION NEEDED]" section with company's solution page style

### Step 1: Find Company's Solution Pages

```bash
# Search for solution pages
kurt content list --include "*/solution*"
kurt content list --include "*/use-case*"
kurt content list --include "*/for-*"

# Alternative patterns
kurt content search "for-|use-case"
```

**If NOT_FETCHED:**
```bash
kurt content fetch --include "*/solution*" --limit 5
kurt content fetch --include "*/use-case*" --limit 5
```

### Step 2: Select 3-5 Examples (Iterative with User)

**Offer suggestions:**
"I found these solution/use-case pages for style analysis:
1. [URL + title]
2. [URL + title]
3. [URL + title]
4. [URL + title]
5. [URL + title]

Use these, or provide different URLs?"

**Maximum: 5 examples**

### Step 3: Analyze Examples

```bash
# Read pages
kurt content get <doc-id-1>
kurt content get <doc-id-2>
```

**Note these patterns:**

**Headlines:**
- Problem-focused ("Stop losing customers to X") or benefit-focused ("Achieve Y faster")?
- Audience-specific ("For enterprise teams") or generic?
- Copy 2-3 headlines

**Problem framing:**
- How much space given to problem vs solution?
- Empathetic/story-driven or data/fact-driven?
- Copy their problem section

**Solution positioning:**
- Lead with "how it works" or "key capabilities"?
- Technical depth vs business benefits?
- Copy solution section structure

**Tone:**
- Formality 1-10
- Customer-centric language?
- Specific to segment or broadly applicable?

**DO/DON'T Examples:**
- Find 2-3 sentences showing best solution page style
- Write contrasting examples
- Note why they avoid certain patterns

**Customer focus:**
- Named customer segments or generic roles?
- Industry-specific examples?
- Use case detail level?

**CTAs:**
- Problem-oriented ("Fix X") or outcome-oriented ("Achieve Y")?
- Copy actual CTA text

### Step 4: Update Style Guidelines Section

**Edit this template file and replace "[CUSTOMIZATION NEEDED]":**

```markdown

### Troubleshooting

**Can't find solution pages?**
- Check: Try "use case" or "for [audience]" pages
- Ask user: "I don't see solution pages. Can you provide 3-5 URLs showing how you position for specific use cases?"

**Only have product pages, not solution pages?**
- Analyze product pages for use case sections
- Ask user: "Do you have pages focused on specific customer problems or use cases?"

**Need customer research?**
- Ask user: "I need insights on customer pain points for [use case]. Can you provide:
  - Customer interview notes
  - Sales call recordings or notes
  - Support ticket themes
  - Survey results"

**Missing proof points?**
- Ask user: "Do you have customer success stories for [use case]? Looking for specific outcomes and quotes."
