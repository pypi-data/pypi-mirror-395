# MotherDuck extension

_[Back to DuckDB Data Engineering Glossary](https://motherduck.com/glossary/)_

The [MotherDuck extension](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/tree/master/extension/motherduck) is a component of [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) that enables seamless integration with the [MotherDuck](https://motherduck.com/) cloud service. This extension allows users to connect their local DuckDB instance to MotherDuck's serverless analytics platform, facilitating hybrid query execution across local and cloud environments. By using the MotherDuck extension, data professionals can leverage the power of cloud computing while maintaining the flexibility of working with data on their local machine. The extension supports features such as remote data access, synchronized schema management, and the ability to push computations to the cloud when needed, enhancing DuckDB's capabilities for handling larger datasets and more complex analytics tasks.
