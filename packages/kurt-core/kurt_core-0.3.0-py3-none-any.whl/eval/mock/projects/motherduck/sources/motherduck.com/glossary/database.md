# database

_[Back to DuckDB Data Engineering Glossary](https://motherduck.com/glossary/)_

A database is a structured collection of data organized for efficient storage, retrieval, and management. It serves as a central repository for information, allowing users to store, query, and manipulate data. Modern databases come in various types, including relational databases like [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) and [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/), which use tables and SQL for data operations, and NoSQL databases like [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) and [Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org/), which offer more flexible data models. Databases are fundamental to most software applications, enabling data persistence, concurrent access, and complex data operations. They play a crucial role in the data stack, forming the foundation for data storage and retrieval in analytics, business intelligence, and application development.
