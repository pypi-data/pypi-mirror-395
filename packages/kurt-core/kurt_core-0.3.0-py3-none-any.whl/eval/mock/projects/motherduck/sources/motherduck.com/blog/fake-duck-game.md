# We made a fake duck game: compete to win!

We made a [game](https://game.motherduck.com/) 🎮.

About ducks.

And fake ducks. Your task is to spot which ducks are fake (a.k.a. AI-generated). Watch out—it’s not as easy as it seems!

![Spot the Duck Game](https://motherduck.com/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmotherduck-com-web-prod.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fassets%2Fimg%2FScreenshot_2024_12_20_at_10_53_55_AM_47b2a745f3.png&w=3840&q=75)

Oh, and there’s a prize if you manage to waddle your way onto the [leaderboard](https://game.motherduck.com/duckleaderboard) 🏆.

![Leaderboard](https://motherduck.com/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmotherduck-com-web-prod.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fassets%2Fimg%2FScreenshot_2024_12_20_at_10_52_49_AM_845bdbe771.png&w=3840&q=75)

The contest runs through the holidays season, from December 20, 2024, to January 4, 2025.

But wait—don’t feel ruffled if you can’t crack the leaderboard during the first week. We’ll take the winners, reset the scores on December 28, and let everyone go quackers again for a second chance at glory.

Let the duck games begin! 🚀

**PS : This game was inspired by another [one](https://huggingface.co/spaces/victor/fake-insects/tree/main) created by [Victor Mustar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/victor-mustar-22466951/). Thanks to Victor for the fun and inspiration—your work is awesome!**
