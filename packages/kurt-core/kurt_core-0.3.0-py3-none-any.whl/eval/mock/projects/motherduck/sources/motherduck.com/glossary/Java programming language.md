# Java programming language

_[Back to DuckDB Data Engineering Glossary](https://motherduck.com/glossary/)_

[Java](https://www.java.com/) is a widely-used, object-oriented programming language designed for portability and cross-platform compatibility. Originally developed by Sun Microsystems and now maintained by Oracle, Java follows the "write once, run anywhere" principle, allowing code to run on any device with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). It's known for its robust standard library, strong typing, and automatic memory management through garbage collection. Java is extensively used in enterprise applications, Android app development, and big data technologies like Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark. For data professionals, Java is valuable for building scalable data processing systems, creating ETL pipelines, and developing data-intensive applications. While not typically a first choice for data analysis compared to Python or R, Java's performance and ecosystem make it a powerful tool for handling large-scale data operations and building production-grade data systems.
