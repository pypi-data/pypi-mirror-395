# Marc Dupuis

Co-Founder, Fabi.ai

As a product manager I was always wrestling with SQL or bugging the data team for analyses. There's a better way with AI.

We're reimagining how data analysis is done in the enterprise. We're on a mission to:
\- Uplevel every data practitioner in the enterprise
\- Bring insights to where the business actually is rather than build another dashboard cemetery
\- Make AI an actual part of the data analysis workflow, not just a code-generator

Since launching Fabi.ai, we've shown data teams, product managers and founders what's possible and saved them collectively thousands of hours, allowing them to do more and grow faster.
