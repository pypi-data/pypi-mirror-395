My name's Graham Wetzler. I live in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metro area where I work (remotely) as a senior analytics engineer. My job involves data modeling as well as managing analytics infrastructure and architecture. Outside of work I enjoy tinkering with computers, continuing to automate my home, and woodworking.
