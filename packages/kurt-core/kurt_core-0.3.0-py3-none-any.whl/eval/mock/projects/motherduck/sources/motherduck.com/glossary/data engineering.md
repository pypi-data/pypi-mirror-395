_[Back to DuckDB Data Engineering Glossary](https://motherduck.com/glossary/)_

Data engineering is the practice of designing, building, and maintaining the infrastructure and systems that enable the collection, storage, processing, and analysis of large volumes of data. It forms a critical foundation for data-driven decision making in organizations. Data engineers are responsible for creating robust data pipelines, implementing data warehouses or lakes, and ensuring data quality and accessibility for downstream users like data analysts and data scientists. They work with various tools and technologies, including databases, ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes, distributed computing frameworks, and cloud platforms. Data engineering bridges the gap between raw data sources and the analytical needs of an organization, making it possible to derive meaningful insights from vast amounts of information. As the field evolves, data engineers increasingly focus on scalability, real-time processing, and data governance to meet the growing demands of modern data-driven enterprises.
