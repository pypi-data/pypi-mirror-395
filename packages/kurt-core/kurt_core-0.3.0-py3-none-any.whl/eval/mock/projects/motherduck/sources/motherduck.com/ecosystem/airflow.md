# AirFlow

ORCHESTRATION

Apache Airflow is an open-source platform designed to programmatically author, schedule, and monitor workflows. It allows users to define tasks and their dependencies as code, enabling dynamic pipeline generation and complex data orchestration. Airflow supports a rich set of integrations and extensibility through custom plugins and operators.

## Apache Airflow + MotherDuck

Apache Airflow integrates with MotherDuck by leveraging custom operators to connect to the MotherDuck cloud data warehouse. This allows users to execute SQL queries and manage data workflows directly within the Airflow environment, utilizing DuckDB's efficient analytical capabilities in a cloud-native setting.
