## A Ducking Perfect Match

It’s time to stop waiting for extracts and time to start exploring data with MotherDuck, now live on Tableau Cloud! This joins our existing integration with [Tableau Desktop and Tableau Server](https://motherduck.com/docs/integrations/bi-tools/tableau/), allowing a seamless experience across the entire Tableau ecosystem. For the first time, it's possible to get an amazing DuckDB-powered experience in Tableau: unparalleled speed, access to live data in your data lake, and a user experience designed for efficiency and peace of mind.

When we first approached Tableau Cloud, we were skeptical that there would be a good path for an awesome experience with MotherDuck. One of the core value props of MotherDuck, a super fast OLAP query engine, was hidden behind data extracts.

Thankfully, with this release, [live connections](https://help.tableau.com/current/online/en-us/to_connect_live_sql.htm) unlocks the amazing query experience of MotherDuck, directly in the Tableau interface. And for those seeking the legacy Tableau experience, data extracts continue work as well.

## Integration Benefits

Let’s look into the benefits of coupling MotherDuck & Tableau Cloud:

1. **Blazing-fast OLAP performance**: Incredibly fast query responses, often in milliseconds for typical BI/Analytical workloads. Build aggregations and filters on-the-fly without the wait.
2. **Not just MotherDuck data**: Data in your data lake in Iceberg, Delta, Parquet, JSON, or CSV and live queried straight into Tableau. Bring the simplicity of DuckDB to the complexities of the reality of your business analytics.
3. **Truly Serverless**: Reduce your cost anxiety with supporting a Live Connection to Tableau with MotherDuck’s per-second billing. No need to maintain an always-on cluster to serve your analytics.

For Data Analysts and BI developers working with data in MotherDuck or in a data lake, building and deploying near-realtime analytics has never been easier. For example, low-latency sales and marketing dashboards are now trivial to deploy. Its easy to see up-to-the minute insights on the performance of your business and drill through into details all in one place.
