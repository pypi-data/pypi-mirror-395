# data build tool (dbt)

_[Back to DuckDB Data Engineering Glossary](https://motherduck.com/glossary/)_

[dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/) is an open-source command-line tool that enables data analysts and engineers to transform data in their warehouses more effectively. It allows users to write modular SQL queries, which can be version-controlled and tested, bringing software engineering best practices to the world of data analytics. dbt works by compiling these SQL models into executable queries and running them against your data warehouse. It supports a wide range of data platforms, including Snowflake, BigQuery, and Redshift. With dbt, you can define dependencies between models, document your data transformations, and even generate data lineage diagrams. This tool is particularly useful for implementing the ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) paradigm, where transformations occur within the data warehouse itself. By using dbt, data teams can collaborate more efficiently, maintain cleaner code, and build more reliable data pipelines.
