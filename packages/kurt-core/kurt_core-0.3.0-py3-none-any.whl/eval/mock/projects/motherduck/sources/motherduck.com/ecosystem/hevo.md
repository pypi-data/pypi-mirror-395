INGESTION

Hevo data is a no-code, fully managed data integration platform that empowers teams to extract, load, and transform data from different sources to their destinations in just a few clicks. It uses smart automation to ensure accurate and uninterrupted data ingestion, so teams can focus on delivering valuable data insights and driving better business decisions.

## HEVO + MOTHERDUCK

Hevo integrates with MotherDuck by moving data from 150+ sources via Amazon S3 into MotherDuck’s cloud data warehouse, keeping datasets fresh and instantly queryable. Hevo’s automated schema handling, near real-time replication, and monitoring facilitate reliable pipelines, while MotherDuck delivers fast, collaborative SQL without warehouse ops; giving teams a low-maintenance, cost-predictable path from source systems to business insights.
