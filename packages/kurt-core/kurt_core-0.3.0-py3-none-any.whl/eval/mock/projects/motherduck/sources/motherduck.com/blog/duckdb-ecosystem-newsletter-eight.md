## Hey, friend 👋

It’s [Marcos](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mlortiz) again, aka “ _DuckDB News Reporter_” with another issue of “This Month in the DuckDB Ecosystem for July 2023.

Another month, another incredible time for the DuckDB ecosystem, especially after an incredible **DuckCon 2023 SF**. So many great tutorials, videos, resources, and even an interesting approach in the eternal comparison between DuckDB and ClickHouse.

As always we share here, this is a two-way conversation: if you have any feedback on this newsletter, feel free to send us an email to _[duckdbnews@motherduck.com](mailto:duckdbnews@motherduck.com)_.
