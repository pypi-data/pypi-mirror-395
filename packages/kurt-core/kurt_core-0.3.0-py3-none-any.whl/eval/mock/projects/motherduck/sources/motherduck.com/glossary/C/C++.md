# C/C++

_[Back to DuckDB Data Engineering Glossary](https://motherduck.com/glossary/)_

[DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) provides a C/C++ API, allowing developers to embed the database directly into C and C++ applications. This integration enables high-performance data processing and analytics capabilities within native applications. The C API follows a design similar to SQLite, making it familiar for developers experienced with that system. For C++ users, DuckDB offers a more idiomatic interface, leveraging modern C++ features. By using the C/C++ API, developers can execute SQL queries, manage transactions, and interact with DuckDB's in-memory or persistent storage directly from their C or C++ codebase. This low-level access is particularly useful for applications requiring tight integration with the database engine or those aiming to minimize overhead in data-intensive operations.
