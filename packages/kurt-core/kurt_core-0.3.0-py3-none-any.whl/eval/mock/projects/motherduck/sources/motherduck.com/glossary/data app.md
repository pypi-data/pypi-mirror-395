_[Back to DuckDB Data Engineering Glossary](https://motherduck.com/glossary/)_

A data app is an interactive software application that allows users to explore, analyze, and visualize data without requiring extensive coding skills. These apps typically combine data processing capabilities with user-friendly interfaces, making complex data analysis accessible to a wider audience. Data apps often leverage frameworks like [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) or [Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/) to create web-based interfaces that can include charts, tables, and interactive elements. They enable users to input parameters, filter data, and generate insights on-demand. Data apps are particularly useful for presenting analytical results to stakeholders, prototyping data products, or creating self-service analytics tools within organizations. By encapsulating data manipulation, visualization, and user interaction in a single package, data apps bridge the gap between raw data and actionable insights, empowering users to make data-driven decisions more efficiently.
