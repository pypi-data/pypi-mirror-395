# Secoda x MotherDuck: The newest member of the Modern Duck Stack 🦆

The latest integration with Secoda gives data teams the ability to search across their entire data infrastructure and see the full end-to-end lineage.

## [Secoda x MotherDuck Integration Overview](https://www.secoda.co/integrations/motherduck)

Secoda creates a single source of truth for an organization’s data. Together with MotherDuck, it allows both data producers and consumers, regardless of technical ability, to easily locate and access the data they need.

## Enhanced Search and Data Discovery

Simplify how you find data using natural language search. Users can easily navigate through their entire data ecosystem, cataloging all relevant data entities such as views, columns, tables, and schemas stored in MotherDuck directly within Secoda. This not only speeds up data retrieval but also simplifies data interaction.

## Data Quality Monitoring and Control

Set monitors and thresholds to automatically detect data quality issues such as duplication, incorrect formatting, and missing values. By identifying potential data quality problems in the very environment where data exploration and discovery occur, you can ensure data reliability and trustworthiness.

## Swift User Onboarding and Access to New Data

The integration streamlines the process of accessing new data, allowing users to quickly find and use live, shared, and governed data sets. With Secoda AI, users can automatically generate documentation of new tables, columns, and schemas in MotherDuck. Automate manual tasks so your team is focusing on higher priority tasks while keeping documentation up to date.

## Automated Data Lineage Tracking

The integration simplifies data lineage tracking by providing clear and accessible visualizations of data lineage across MotherDuck and other data sources. Understand all upstream and downstream dependencies and surface critical relationships between tables and columns.

## Automated Governance Policy Enforcement

The integration of Secoda with MotherDuck enables organizations to define and implement detailed governance policies efficiently. This includes setting up role-based access controls, identifying and tagging personally identifiable information (PII), and ensuring all data assets comply with governance standards.
