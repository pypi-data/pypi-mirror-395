# Dot

BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE

🤖 Dot, the data bot is an intelligent virtual data assistance that answers business data questions, retrieves definitions and relevant data assets, and can even assist with data modelling.

🧠 Leverages the power of large language models combined with your data stack (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, see all Integrations) and documentation of processes and metrics.

✅ Ships with a developer training space that ensures the data team is in the driver seat and results from Dot are validated. Say No to hallucinations.
