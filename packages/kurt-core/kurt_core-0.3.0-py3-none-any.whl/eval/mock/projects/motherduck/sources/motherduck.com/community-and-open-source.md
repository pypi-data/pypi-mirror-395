If you're not familiar with DuckDB, you definitely want to give it a look. I've recently converted all my existing code from using CSV files and SQLite databases for exploratory analysis to parquet files, DuckDB and MotherDuck. The transformation in my workflow has been nothing short of astounding. 10GB of CSV files turned into 1GB of parquet files that are now stored in S3 buckets. Using DuckDB and MotherDuck, I can run exploratory queries seamlessly thanks to the DuckStack with dual execution with local processing and cloud scale. My query development time has decreased by 90%. And I'm loving the team feature of the MotherDuck platform.

DuckDB is my new best friend for analytics. It's so fast, makes it easy to manipulate dataframes, ingests anything, and exports it to whatever form I want. \\

Parquet, Arrow dataframes, and DuckDB are the future for analytics.](https://x.com/ethanf_17/status/1809835395695407529)

#duckdb is really impressive: good terminal client, solid, easy and fast import of csv data and impressive speed on a 20mio data set. With automatic schema creation. Easy export to parquet and more. I think I am gonna spend more time on it...](https://twitter.com/uweeegeee/status/1611663518033498117)
