### Data Warehousing

Is your data all over the place? Start making sense of your business by bringing it together for internal business intelligence and analytics. Build pure SQL pipelines, share data and quickly collaborate with your team.

[How it Works](https://motherduck.com/docs/getting-started/data-warehouse/)

[Case Studies](https://motherduck.com/case-studies/)

### Customer-facing Analytics

Unlike traditional BI, customer-facing analytics is built directly into your product for end users. It delivers near real-time, low-latency insights at scale — think milliseconds, not minutes — and must handle thousands to millions of concurrent queries. MotherDuck's architecture, from per-user tenancy to Wasm support, is designed for the unique requirements of Customer-Facing Analytics to drive increased user engagement directly in your app experience.

## How We Scale

### Duckling Sizes

MotherDuck’s per-user tenancy model gives each user an isolated
duckling

![Tooltip Duckling illustration](https://motherduck.com/_next/image/?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Ftooltip-duckling-illus.32805477.png&w=3840&q=75)

A Duckling is a dedicated DuckDB instance for each user, ensuring optimal performance and scalability in data analytics.

(DuckDB instance) in one of five sizes to enable individual, user-level configuration.

![MotherDuck Assets illustration](https://motherduck.com/_next/image/?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fmotherduck-assets-illus.f80662b9.png&w=3840&q=75)

![Pulse Duckling](https://motherduck.com/_next/image/?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fduckling-1-placeholder.8fd25135.png&w=3840&q=75)

![Pulse Instance type illustration](https://motherduck.com/_next/image/?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Finstance-type-illus-pulse.8c39b9cc.png&w=3840&q=75)

Pulse

Our smallest instance, perfect for ad-hoc analytics tasks

![Standard Duckling](https://motherduck.com/_next/image/?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fduckling-2-placeholder.e3942696.png&w=3840&q=75)

![Standard Instance type illustration](https://motherduck.com/_next/image/?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Finstance-type-illus-standard.3d0ae9e9.png&w=3840&q=75)

Standard

Built to handle common data warehouse workloads, including loads and transforms

![Jumbo Duckling](https://motherduck.com/_next/image/?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fduckling-3-placeholder.9e54ea44.png&w=3840&q=75)

![Jumbo Instance type illustration](https://motherduck.com/_next/image/?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Finstance-type-illus-jumbo.b77c7bca.png&w=3840&q=75)

Jumbo

For larger data warehouse workloads with many transformations or complex aggregations

![Mega Duckling](https://motherduck.com/_next/image/?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fduckling-4-placeholder.356f25ee.png&w=3840&q=75)

Mega

An extremely large instance for when you need complex transformations done quickly

![Giga Duckling](https://motherduck.com/_next/image/?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fduckling-5-placeholder.7ca13555.png&w=3840&q=75)

![Giga Instance type illustration](https://motherduck.com/_next/image/?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Finstance-type-illus-giga.3228dda6.png&w=3840&q=75)

Giga

Largest instances enable the toughest transformations to run faster

[DUCKLING SIZES](https://motherduck.com/product/pricing/#instance-types)

### Per-user tenancy   and vertical scaling

MotherDuck employs a per-user tenancy and vertical scaling strategy. Users connect to their own MotherDuck Ducklings (DuckDB instances), which are sized (pulse, standard, jumbo, mega, giga) to meet their specific needs. There is also the option for additional Ducklings, through read scaling (explained below), to ensure flexible resource allocation. Ultimately, each Duckling establishes a connection with the central Data Warehouse storage.

![Per-user tenancy      and vertical scaling](https://motherduck.com/_next/image/?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fhow-we-scale-per-user-tenancy.3641ecda.png&w=3840&q=75)

### Read Scaling

MotherDuck's read scaling capabilities allow users to connect via a BI Tool to dedicated Ducklings that function as read replicas. These read replicas can be provisioned in various sizes (pulse, standard, jumbo, mega or giga) to accommodate different needs. Ultimately, these read replicas connect to the Data Warehouse storage, enabling efficient handling of read operations.

Instant SQL in MotherDuck will save me the misery of having to try and wrangle SQL in my BI tool where iteration speed can be very slow. This lets me get the data right earlier in the process and with faster feedback than waiting for a chart to render, or having to clear an analytics cache.

MotherDuck with DuckDB was by far the fastest of the OLAP platforms we evaluated - both in the cloud and run on our developer's machines - bridging price and performance and greatly increasing productivity.

We used to do analytics in a MySQL database with all of our daily device, telemetry, and image processing data. There was no way to scale that further using MySQL. With MotherDuck, we’re finally starting to find patterns in our data to help customers grow produce more effectively.

Moving to MotherDuck, a billed by-the-second cloud offering is a no-brainer for us, considering the elegance and efficiency of a single node system compared to traditional OLAP solutions.

Instant SQL in MotherDuck will save me the misery of having to try and wrangle SQL in my BI tool where iteration speed can be very slow. This lets me get the data right earlier in the process and with faster feedback than waiting for a chart to render, or having to clear an analytics cache.

If you're not familiar with DuckDB, you definitely want to give it a look. I've recently converted all my existing code from using CSV files and SQLite databases for exploratory analysis to parquet files, DuckDB and MotherDuck. The transformation in my workflow has been nothing short of astounding. 10GB of CSV files turned into 1GB of parquet files that are now stored in S3 buckets. Using DuckDB and MotherDuck, I can run exploratory queries seamlessly thanks to the DuckStack with dual execution with local processing and cloud scale. My query development time has decreased by 90%. And I'm loving the team feature of the MotherDuck platform. OCEANCODA is rocking the small data life! #duckdb #python #motherduck #eda #ai #ml (Graphic courtesy of Manning Publications Co. book 'DuckDB in Action.' ) Check it out.](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7221573493295910912/)

This MotherDuck thingy is such a beauty it brings a tear to me old eye. You have no idea how many new tools (maybe you do) I agonize over while trying to bring you the good, the bad, and the ugly.](https://dataengineeringcentral.substack.com/p/honest-review-of-motherduck)

MotherDuck ... bringing big innovation to SQL to make it more like a real language and less like a 'groovy ancient programming language from the 70s.'

The progress on the MotherDuck UI is amazing! It went from minimal utility to my preferred place to write SQL in a matter of months](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:ugcPost:7163558312741982208?commentUrn=ur[%E2%80%A6]89847054557184%2Curn%3Ali%3AugcPost%3A7163558312741982208%29)

I'm just checking a little about the hosted DuckDB by @motherduck. What a nice user experience. It automatically detects errors, and \`accept & run\` fixes common errors. Love it.](https://x.com/sspaeti/status/1798290369110749458)

If you're not familiar with DuckDB, you definitely want to give it a look. I've recently converted all my existing code from using CSV files and SQLite databases for exploratory analysis to parquet files, DuckDB and MotherDuck. The transformation in my workflow has been nothing short of astounding. 10GB of CSV files turned into 1GB of parquet files that are now stored in S3 buckets. Using DuckDB and MotherDuck, I can run exploratory queries seamlessly thanks to the DuckStack with dual execution with local processing and cloud scale. My query development time has decreased by 90%. And I'm loving the team feature of the MotherDuck platform. OCEANCODA is rocking the small data life! #duckdb #python #motherduck #eda #ai #ml (Graphic courtesy of Manning Publications Co. book 'DuckDB in Action.' ) Check it out.](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7221573493295910912/)

DuckDB is increasingly being built into every data tool, but DuckDB isn't designed to be used as a cloud data warehouse\\
\\
@motherduck is solving that problem, and they’re doing it in a delightful, uniquely DuckDB way](https://x.com/evidence_dev/status/1801630536252768584)

DuckDB is my new best friend for analytics. It's so fast, makes it easy to manipulate dataframes, ingests anything, and exports it to whatever form I want. \\
\\
Parquet, Arrow dataframes, and DuckDB are the future for analytics.](https://x.com/ethanf_17/status/1809835395695407529)
