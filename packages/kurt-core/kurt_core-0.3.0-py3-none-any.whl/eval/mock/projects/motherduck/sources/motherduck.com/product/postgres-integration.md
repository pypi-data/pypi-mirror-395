## PostgreSQL wasn’t built for analytics

PostgreSQL is brilliant for transactions, but struggles with analytical workloads.

Row-oriented storage hurts performance

PostgreSQL stores data row-by-row, making analytical queries scan unnecessary data and waste I/O on columns you don't need.

Spiky analytics workloads conflict with transactions

Large analytical queries can overwhelm your database, and using read replicas means your analytics run on outdated data as transactions queue up.

Management overhead wastes resources

Keeping PostgreSQL performant for analytics means managing indexes, tweaking configurations, optimizing queries, and monitoring resource contention.

## Analytical power inside PostgreSQL

MotherDuck plus PostgreSQL using the pg\_duckdb extension lends analytical power to your transactional database when you need it most.

### Dramatic analytical performance gains

Up to 20x faster queries in cases where PostgreSQL alone struggles, thanks to DuckDB's vectorized execution engine.

### Query operational and cloud data together

Join PostgreSQL and MotherDuck tables, including data stored in cloud object stores like S3 and GCS.

### Zero data movement analytics

Run fast, lightweight queries on your existing PostgreSQL data without copying or moving it elsewhere.

### Hybrid workload optimization

Keep OLTP operations fast on PostgreSQL while handling OLAP queries through DuckDB's optimized engine.
