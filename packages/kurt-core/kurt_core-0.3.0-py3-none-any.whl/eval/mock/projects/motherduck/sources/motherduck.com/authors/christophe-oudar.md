# Christophe Oudar

Guest Author (and Staff Software Engineer)

Software engineering is not only a job but also a passion for me. It brings impressive challenges such as scalability, concurrency or caching. Big data is a great field to deal with them and to strive to excel in. I also love mobile technologies and especially those related to smartphones. If you go through my profile, you'll notice some personal projects are on Android or iOS.
Finally I'm fond of innovative projects and always eager to be able work on habit breaking and world changing stuff!
