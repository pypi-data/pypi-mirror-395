# Linux

[Back to DuckDB Data Engineering Glossary](https://motherduck.com/glossary/)

[Linux](https://www.linux.org/) is an open-source operating system kernel that forms the foundation of many popular distributions used in data engineering and analytics. It's known for its stability, security, and flexibility, making it a preferred choice for servers and data processing environments. Linux distributions like Ubuntu, CentOS, and Debian are widely used to host databases, run data pipelines, and deploy analytics tools. As an aspiring data professional, you'll likely encounter Linux servers when working with cloud platforms or on-premises data infrastructure. Its command-line interface allows for powerful scripting and automation capabilities, essential for managing large-scale data operations. Familiarity with basic Linux commands and system administration can greatly enhance your ability to work with distributed data systems and cloud-based analytics platforms.
