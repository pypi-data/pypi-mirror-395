# pg\_duckdb: Ducking awesome analytics in Postgres

2025/06/12

Video of a conference talk highlighting pg\_duckdb, a new open-source Postgres extension that makes it easy and fast to run analytics queries straight from within Postgres. You can often use pg\_duckdb to speed up your slowest Postgres queries significantly without having to make any changes to your query, data or schema! And if you want to speed up your queries even more, that's possible too. pg\_duckdb makes it very easy to store some of your data remotely in columnar format in S3, Azure blob storage, MotherDuck and more.

In this talk you'll learn:

1. How you can use pg\_duckdb to speed up your Postgres queries

2. How pg\_duckdb can be so much faster than Postgres for analytics queries

3. How you can utilize remote columnar data storage to make your queries even faster
