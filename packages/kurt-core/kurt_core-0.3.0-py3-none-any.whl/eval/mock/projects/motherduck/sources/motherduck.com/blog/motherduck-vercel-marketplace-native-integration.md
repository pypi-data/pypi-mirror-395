MotherDuck, the serverless backend for analytics, is now available as a [native integration on the Vercel Marketplace](https://vercel.com/marketplace/motherduck). Developers can now use MotherDuck for their Vercel projects when building embedded analytics or data applications and components for the web.

Combined with our [Next.js demo application](https://motherduck-wasm-analytics-quickstart.vercel.app/) and [template](https://github.com/MotherDuck-Open-Source/nextjs-motherduck-wasm-analytics-quickstart), we’re committed to simplifying how developers build analytics-backed components and applications for the web.

And if you prefer watching to reading, we've got you covered.

## Why Do Developers Need an Analytics Backend?

Building fast, interactive web experiences is what developers do best—but that’s only part of the equation. You also need to maintain your application as you scale, and a huge piece of the equation is often analytics.

Relying on your application database for complex analytics not only strains your backend; it can also degrade the overall user experience in the long run.

Using a serverless backend for analytics, or an [(OLAP) database](https://motherduck.com/learn-more/what-is-OLAP/) like MotherDuck helps ensure scalability and performance as your app's usage grows while protecting the integrity of your system. Stop hacking workarounds just to make analytics work!

MotherDuck steps in to solve these challenges:

- **Ergonomic and developer-friendly:** Modern, effortless, and built to integrate with your existing stack without overhead.

- **Serverless simplicity:** No need to worry about managing infrastructure—MotherDuck scales effortlessly with your application.

- **Unified local + cloud workflow:** Develop locally with unparalleled speed and then push to MotherDuck for production-ready analytics in the cloud - it’s all backed by the same database for a frictionless experience. Read on to learn more about our [1.5-tier architecture](https://motherduck.com/product/app-developers/#architecture) that enables client-side Javascript to process data locally.


Whether you’re building customer-facing analytics in your application or internal dashboards for operational business analytics, MotherDuck makes working with data easy, fast, and powerful.

## Why Build on Vercel Marketplace?

MotherDuck’s serverless backend for analytics provides the following advantages for Vercel projects:

- **Simple deployment and consolidated billing:** The Vercel Marketplace [native integration](https://vercel.com/marketplace/motherduck) makes connecting to MotherDuck as easy as clicking a button with no additional setup needed. All you need to do is create an account and continue using Vercel as you would normally, with Vercel managing billing and rolling up a consolidated invoice each month.

- **Cost-efficient serverless model:** Pay only for what you use, with no upfront costs or resource provisioning headaches.

- **Future-proof your app for scale:** As your web application gains traction, MotherDuck scales alongside you, ensuring analytics remain snappy and reliable.


Decoupling analytics from your core web application and transactional database ensures high availability and scalability without the maintenance overhead of constantly needing to tune your application.

## Introducing the Next.js Wasm Demo Application and Template

To make it easy to get started with the integration, we have built a [demo application](https://motherduck-wasm-analytics-quickstart.vercel.app/) using Next.js and WebAssembly [(Wasm)](https://webassembly.org/) and made it available as a 1-click deployable [Next.js Wasm template](https://github.com/MotherDuck-Open-Source/nextjs-motherduck-wasm-analytics-quickstart).

With the [MotherDuck native integration on Vercel Marketplace](https://vercel.com/marketplace/motherduck), you no longer need to build embedded analytics components or data applications from scratch or worry about scaling constraints around latency and reliability as your web application becomes more widely used.

Decoupling analytics from your core application backend simplifies developer maintenance and delivers fast, responsive insights that meet users' high expectations today.

- **Wasm-powered frontend performance:** Eliminate unnecessary server round trips to process up to 60 queries per second for an incredibly responsive user experience. MotherDuck’s high-velocity DuckDB-powered analytics engine executes client side directly in the browser, enabling real-time local query processing during development.

- **Purpose-built for analytics:** MotherDuck is optimized for query performance and analytics, not just data storage, to give developers and users swift, actionable insights and blazing-fast performance compared to traditional relational databases.

- **Deploy interactive insights in minutes:** Use the [Next.js Wasm template](https://github.com/MotherDuck-Open-Source/nextjs-motherduck-wasm-analytics-quickstart) to set up a live analytics dashboard that can handle real-world use cases—no data engineering expertise required.


It’s finally possible to deliver powerfully interactive, embedded analytics directly in your web applications by using MotherDuck as your [serverless backend for analytics on Vercel Marketplace](https://vercel.com/marketplace/motherduck).
