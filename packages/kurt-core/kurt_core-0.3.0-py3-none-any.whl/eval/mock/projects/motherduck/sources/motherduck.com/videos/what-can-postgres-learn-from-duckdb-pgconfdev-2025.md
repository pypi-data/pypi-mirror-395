2025/06/13

Presented by Jelte Fennema-Nio at PGConf.dev 2025 ( [https://2025.pgconf.dev](https://2025.pgconf.dev/))

DuckDB an open source SQL analytics engine that is quickly growing in popularity. There are three main reasons for this:

It is very fast at analytics workloads
It is extremely extensible
It has made some nice improvements to its SQL syntax
This begs the question: What can Postgres learn from DuckDB? In this talk I'll discuss how Postgres could learn from some of the things that DuckDB did differently.
