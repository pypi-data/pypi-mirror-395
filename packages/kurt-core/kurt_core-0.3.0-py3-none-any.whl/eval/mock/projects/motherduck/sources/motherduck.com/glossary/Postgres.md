# Postgres

[Back to DuckDB Data Engineering Glossary](https://motherduck.com/glossary/)

[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), often referred to as Postgres, is a powerful open-source relational database management system. It's known for its robustness, extensibility, and compliance with SQL standards. Postgres supports advanced data types and performance optimizations, making it suitable for both small applications and large-scale enterprise systems. It offers features like ACID compliance, complex queries, and foreign keys, which are essential for maintaining data integrity. Many data professionals appreciate Postgres for its ability to handle concurrent users efficiently and its support for JSON, making it adaptable to both structured and semi-structured data needs. As an aspiring data analyst or engineer, you might encounter Postgres as the backbone of many data-driven applications or as a source for data extraction in ETL processes.
