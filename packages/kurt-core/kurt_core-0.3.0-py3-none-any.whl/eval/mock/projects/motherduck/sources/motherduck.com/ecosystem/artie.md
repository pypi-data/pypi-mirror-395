# Artie

INGESTION

Artie is the modern data infrastructure layer for the AI era — a fully managed CDC streaming platform that keeps production data continuously in sync with your warehouse.

As companies activate their warehouses for real-time AI workloads, analytics, and customer-facing data products, they're standardizing on infrastructure that's fast, reliable, and built for scale.

Artie automates the entire ingestion lifecycle — change capture, merges, backfills, and observability — with zero engineering maintenance and deploys in minutes.

Leaders like Substack, ClickUp, and Alloy use Artie not just to solve today's pipeline issues, but to future-proof their data stack as their AI strategy accelerates.

## Artie + MotherDuck

With Artie's MotherDuck integration, you can stream data from sources like PostgreSQL, SQL Server, and MySQL into your MotherDuck data warehouse–perfect for running analytical queries on your application data or integrating with third-party data in a single warehouse.
