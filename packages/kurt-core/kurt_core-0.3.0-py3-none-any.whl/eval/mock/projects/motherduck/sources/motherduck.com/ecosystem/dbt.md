TRANSFORMATION

dbt (data build tool) is a command-line tool that enables data analysts and engineers to transform data in their warehouse more effectively. It allows users to write modular SQL queries, test data integrity, and document data transformations, streamlining the analytics engineering workflow. dbt supports version control and collaboration, making it easier for teams to manage and deploy data models.

## dbt + MotherDuck

dbt integrates with MotherDuck by allowing users to perform data transformations and analytics directly within the MotherDuck cloud data warehouse. By connecting dbt to MotherDuck, users can leverage DuckDB's efficient query execution engine for transforming and modeling data, ensuring seamless and optimized data workflows. This integration empowers teams to build, test, and document their data pipelines efficiently while utilizing MotherDuck's scalable and performant data infrastructure.

Since both dbt and DuckDB can run locally, users can do development and testing using the same technologies they run in production.
