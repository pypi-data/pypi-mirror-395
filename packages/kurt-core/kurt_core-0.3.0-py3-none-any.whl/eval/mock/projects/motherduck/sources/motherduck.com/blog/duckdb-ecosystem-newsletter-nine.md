# This Month in the DuckDB Ecosystem: August 2023

## Hey, friend 👋

It’s [Marcos](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mlortiz) again, aka “ _DuckDB News Reporter_” with another issue of “This Month in the DuckDB Ecosystem for August 2023.

This month proves what we are already seeing in our internal channels: the DuckDB ecosystem is growing stronger with time: more companies like [Rill Data](https://www.rilldata.com/blog/fast-duckdb-powered-dashboards) are considering using DuckDB for production environments, more people [are considering DuckDB for fast data analysis development](https://motherduck.com/blog/exploring-stackoverflow-with-duckdb-on-motherduck-1/), and so on.

As always we share here, this is a two-way conversation: if you have any feedback on this newsletter, feel free to send us an email to _[duckdbnews@motherduck.com](mailto:duckdbnews@motherduck.com)_

-Marcos

### Archie Sarre Wood

Archie Sarre Wood is Head of community at [Evidence](https://evidence.dev/) an open source, code-based alternative to drag-and-drop BI tools. He has recently built a great [VS Code extension for DuckDB.](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Evidence.sqltools-duckdb-driver). It allows you to connect to a local, in-memory or MotherDuck (via service token) DuckDB instance and run queries. It also supports exploring db, tables and columns in the explorer view among other features!
