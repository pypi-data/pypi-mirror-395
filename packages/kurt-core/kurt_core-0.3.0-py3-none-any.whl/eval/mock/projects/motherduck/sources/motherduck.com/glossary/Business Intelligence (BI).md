# Business Intelligence (BI)

_[Back to DuckDB Data Engineering Glossary](https://motherduck.com/glossary/)_

Business Intelligence (BI) refers to the technologies, applications, and practices used to collect, integrate, analyze, and present business information. BI tools help organizations make data-driven decisions by transforming raw data into actionable insights. These tools often provide interactive dashboards, reports, and visualizations that allow users to explore data, identify trends, and monitor key performance indicators (KPIs). Popular BI platforms include [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/), [Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/), and [Looker](https://looker.com/). BI solutions typically connect to various data sources, such as databases, data warehouses, and cloud storage, to provide a comprehensive view of an organization's operations. While traditional BI focused on historical reporting, modern BI tools often incorporate predictive analytics and real-time data processing capabilities to support more proactive decision-making.
