BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE

Evidence is an open-source analytics tool that allows data teams to create and share reports using SQL and Markdown. It is designed to enable seamless collaboration and real-time data analysis, offering features like version control, interactive dashboards, and automated reporting. Evidence leverages a simple, intuitive interface to help analysts and engineers convert raw data into actionable insights without extensive coding.

## Evidence + MotherDuck

Evidence integrates with MotherDuck by connecting directly to the MotherDuck cloud data warehouse. This allows users to run SQL queries on their data stored in MotherDuck, enabling them to build and share interactive reports and dashboards with real-time data fetched from the DuckDB-based backend. The integration ensures that data analysts and engineers can leverage the scalability and speed of MotherDuck while using Evidence's user-friendly reporting tools.
