# Jupyter notebooks

[Back to DuckDB Data Engineering Glossary](https://motherduck.com/glossary/)

[Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) are interactive, web-based computing environments that allow data analysts and scientists to create and share documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. These notebooks support multiple programming languages, with Python being the most popular. Users can execute code cells individually or in sequence, making them ideal for exploratory data analysis, prototyping, and creating reproducible research. Jupyter notebooks seamlessly blend code execution with rich text elements, enabling users to document their thought process alongside their analysis. They integrate well with data science libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and scikit-learn, making them a versatile tool for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning tasks. Many cloud platforms, including Google Colab and Azure Notebooks, offer hosted Jupyter environments, allowing for collaborative work and easy sharing of analysis results.
