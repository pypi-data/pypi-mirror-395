# Apache Superset

_[Back to DuckDB Data Engineering Glossary](https://motherduck.com/glossary/)_

[Apache Superset](https://superset.apache.org/) is an open-source data exploration and visualization platform that empowers users to create interactive dashboards and perform ad-hoc analysis. It offers a user-friendly interface for connecting to various data sources, including popular databases and data warehouses. Superset allows analysts to write SQL queries directly or use a no-code interface to build charts and dashboards. The platform supports a wide range of chart types and provides features like drill-down capabilities, custom color schemes, and advanced filtering options. Superset also includes security features for access control and can be integrated with existing authentication systems. As part of the Apache Software Foundation, Superset benefits from a vibrant community of contributors and is continuously evolving to meet the needs of modern data teams.
