# Go programming language

_[Back to DuckDB Data Engineering Glossary](https://motherduck.com/glossary/)_

The [Go programming language](https://golang.org/), often referred to as Golang, is a statically typed, compiled language designed by Google engineers Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. Released in 2009, Go aims to combine the efficiency and safety of compiled languages like C++ with the simplicity and ease of use found in interpreted languages like Python. It features built-in concurrency support, garbage collection, and a robust standard library, making it well-suited for building scalable, high-performance applications, particularly in distributed systems and cloud environments. Go's syntax is clean and minimalist, emphasizing readability and maintainability, which can be particularly appealing to data engineers working on complex data pipeline projects or microservices architectures. While not as commonly used in data analysis as Python or R, Go is gaining traction in the data engineering space for its speed and efficiency in handling large-scale data processing tasks.
