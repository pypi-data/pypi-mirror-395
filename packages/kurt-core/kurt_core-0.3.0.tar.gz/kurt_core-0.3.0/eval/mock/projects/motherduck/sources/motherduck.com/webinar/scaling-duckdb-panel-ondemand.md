DeepSeek's smallpond has taken the data world by storm with its distributed DuckDB capabilities and impressive 110TB benchmarks. But what are your real options for scaling DuckDB today?

- Mike Ritchie (Founder, Definite)

They'll cut through the hype and discuss scaling strategies from single-node powerhouses to distributed architectures.

Learn when to scale up versus out, compare serverless and distributed approaches, and discover the right solution for your data volumes—whether you're working with gigabytes or petabytes.
