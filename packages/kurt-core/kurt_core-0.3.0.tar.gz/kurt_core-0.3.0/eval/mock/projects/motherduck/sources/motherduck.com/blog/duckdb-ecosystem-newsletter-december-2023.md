## Hey, friend 👋

It’s [Marcos](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mlortiz) again, aka “DuckDB News Reporter” with another issue of “This Month in the DuckDB Ecosystem" for December 2023. We are closing 2023 and yet, there's some great content in this edition. I'm curious to see specifically where WASM is going to lead the data world in 2024!

Wishing that 2024 brings all your data dreams to life and carries health and joy to you and your family!
