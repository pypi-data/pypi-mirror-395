## Transform Solo DuckDB Into a Collaborative Powerhouse

DuckDB's in-process nature means your data stays trapped on your machine. MotherDuck eliminates this limitation with a simple "md:" prefix.

![](https://motherduck.com/_next/image/?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fshare-data-not-files.db8baefd.png&w=3840&q=75)

### Share Data, Not Files

No more exporting files or managing S3 buckets to share your work. Create database shares with specific team members while maintaining the familiar DuckDB experience.

![](https://motherduck.com/_next/image/?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fmultiple-users-one-database.0b9d7dc7.png&w=3840&q=75)

### Multiple Users, One Database

Enable simultaneous access for Data Engineers, Analytics teams, and Scientists to the same datasets. Each user gets their own dedicated compute instance “duckling” for concurrent queries without conflicts.

## Local Speed with Cloud-Scale Production Power

Enjoy the best of both worlds with a seamless dev/prod workflow for your data. Develop locally for immediate feedback, then deploy identical workloads to the cloud with zero code changes.

![](https://motherduck.com/_next/image/?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Frapid-iteration-zero-cost.ff94f539.png&w=3840&q=75)

### Rapid Iteration at Zero Cost

Experiment locally with lightning-fast feedback cycles without spending a dime. When your solution is ready, your exact same queries work in the cloud by simply adding "md:" to your connection.

![](https://motherduck.com/_next/image/?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Ftest-safely-deploy-confidently.ed329fbf.png&w=3840&q=75)

### Test Safely, Deploy Confidently

Prototype complex data transformations without risking expensive cloud resources. This local dev, cloud prod model ensures what works locally will perform at scale in production.

![](https://motherduck.com/_next/image/?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fship-data-solutions-faster.bdfdd521.png&w=3840&q=75)

### Ship Data Solutions Faster

Eliminate the friction between development and deployment environments. Your team can innovate with quick local tests and push proven solutions to cloud production seamlessly.

## Familiar Interface with Intelligent Superpowers

MotherDuck maintains the DuckDB interface you love while adding thoughtful, AI-backed intelligent assistance. Experience enhanced productivity with features designed for SQL experts and business users.

![](https://motherduck.com/_next/image/?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fvisual-insights-at-a-glance.60ec6358.png&w=3840&q=75)

### Visual Insights at a Glance

Beautiful visualizations help you understand complex data patterns immediately. MotherDuck's design affordances make exploration intuitive while preserving the power of DuckDB's analytical capabilities.

![](https://motherduck.com/_next/image/?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fautomatic-error-correction.fe59afe0.png&w=3840&q=75)

### Automatic Error Correction

"Fix It" repairs common syntax errors with a single click, eliminating frustration from missing commas or quotes. This intelligent assistance ensures everyone on your team can work productively with SQL, regardless of expertise level.

![](https://motherduck.com/_next/image/?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fnatural-language-to-sql.72331bc3.png&w=3840&q=75)

### Natural Language to SQL

Never written SQL before? Non-technical team members can contribute with "PROMPT QUERY" turning plain English into correct SQL. This feature democratizes data access by removing the barrier of SQL syntax knowledge.

We can create an instance per customer easily as opposed to Postgres, where it’s a hassle to create and manage that many instances. We've now got these new levers for performance scaling because we can split and store the data and query efficiently as needed. If we need to handle a load spike or a huge amount of queries, we can spin up more ducklings on demand.

Our data pipelines used to take eight hours. Now they're taking eight minutes, and I see a world where they take eight seconds. This is why we made the big bet on DuckDB and MotherDuck. It's only possible with DuckDB and MotherDuck.

With MotherDuck, it only took an hour to get an app up and running, which was pretty cool. It uses 18 million rows of data, but once it’s loaded, we have all this interactivity right on the website. And since it's all coming from MotherDuck, we can create a shareable snapshot of our data that others can attach to and query.
