# The Small Data Manifesto

It’s time to **think small**.

## We believe in the Simple Joys of Small Data.

It’s finally possible to hold Big Data in the palm of your hand.

Is that Big Data or Small Data? That's for you to decide.

Local-first development is more powerful than you think.

Modern hardware is a beast.

Small models drive huge impact.

Small data, smart AI.

**Think small, develop locally, ship joyfully.**

## More Data ≠ Better Results.

Our data is subject to the law of diminishing returns.

Most data we use is recent data.

Recent data is the most valuable slice of our data.

Bigger data has an opportunity cost: Time.

Machine Learning on large data is expensive, and small models deliver huge impact.

Less is more.

## Single Machines are Efficient and Powerful.

Simplicity is scalable: chaos and complexity are not.

Scale-up workflows are highly efficient, with 400X more memory than 10 years ago.

Let’s focus on delightful user experiences instead of fumbling with complex infrastructure.

We can save distributed compute for when we really need it most.

Single machines **rule**.

## Developing Locally Just Works.

Local dev delivers instant results, while local + edge computing unlock powerful new experiences.

Ditch the distributed complexity when you don’t need it.

Not everything we build should require inefficient containers or a round-trip to the cloud.

Hardware and laptops are 100X more powerful, yet we leave this compute dormant and unused.

We believe in developing locally and shipping to prod with the same software.

Together, we can end the cloud hangover and support local analytics.

**Small data and AI is more valuable than you think.**

## Something Small is Happening

[Small Data SF](https://www.smalldatasf.com/) is a day for developers and data practitioners to come together and engage in productive community discussions on making the most of ‘small data’ volumes to build useful, meaningful analytics and AI experiences.

Computers are now one hundred times more powerful than when the early hype of the Big Data movement was in full swing. Let’s focus on the underrated joys and untapped potential of using laptops, cloud machines, and edge computing to their full potential to create simple, scalable analytics workflows, applications, and machine learning models.

The Small Data Movement is already underway. Are you in?
