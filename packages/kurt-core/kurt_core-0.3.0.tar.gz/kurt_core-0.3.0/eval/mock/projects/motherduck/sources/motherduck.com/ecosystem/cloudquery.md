# CloudQuery

INGESTION

CloudQuery is an open-source data integration platform that enables the transformation of cloud assets into SQL-accessible databases. It helps organizations extract, transform, and load (ETL) data from various cloud providers into a format suitable for analysis and monitoring. CloudQuery supports a wide range of cloud services and offers a flexible configuration for custom data pipelines.

## CloudQuery + MotherDuck

CloudQuery integrates with MotherDuck by allowing users to load and transform data from multiple cloud sources directly into the MotherDuck cloud data warehouse. This integration leverages CloudQuery’s ETL capabilities to efficiently funnel data into MotherDuck, making it accessible for advanced analytics and querying through DuckDB's SQL engine.
