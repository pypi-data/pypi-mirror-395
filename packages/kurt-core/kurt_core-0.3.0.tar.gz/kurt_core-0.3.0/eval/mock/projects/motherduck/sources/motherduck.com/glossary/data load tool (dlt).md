_[Back to DuckDB Data Engineering Glossary](https://motherduck.com/glossary/)_

[Data Load Tool (dlt)](https://github.com/dlt-hub/dlt) is an open-source Python library designed to simplify the process of building data pipelines. It automates many of the tedious aspects of data ingestion, allowing data professionals to focus on the core logic of their pipelines. dlt supports extracting data from various sources, including APIs and databases, and loading it into destinations like data warehouses or data lakes. The library infers schemas automatically, handles data type conversions, and manages incremental loading to ensure efficient updates. By providing a consistent interface across different data sources and destinations, dlt enables data engineers and analysts to create robust, maintainable pipelines with minimal boilerplate code. This tool is particularly useful for those looking to streamline their extract, load, transform (ELT) workflows in modern data architectures.
