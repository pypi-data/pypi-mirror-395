# GitHub

_[Back to DuckDB Data Engineering Glossary](https://motherduck.com/glossary/)_

[GitHub](https://github.com/) is a web-based platform for version control and collaboration, widely used in software development and data engineering. It provides a centralized repository for storing, tracking, and managing code changes, making it easier for teams to work together on projects. GitHub utilizes Git, a distributed version control system, as its underlying technology.

Data professionals often use GitHub to store and share code, datasets, and documentation. It offers features like pull requests for code review, issue tracking for project management, and actions for automating workflows. Many open-source data tools and libraries are hosted on GitHub, allowing users to contribute to their development or report bugs.

For data analysts and engineers, GitHub can serve as a portfolio to showcase their projects and skills. It also facilitates collaboration on data pipelines, analytics scripts, and machine learning models. The platform's integration capabilities with various development and deployment tools make it an essential part of many modern data stacks and CI/CD pipelines.
