## For App Devs

Fast, fresh analytics for data-driven applications and components shouldn’t be an uphill battle with your operational DWH.

## For Data Teams

The hardest part of getting value from your data is going from question to insight - it doesn’t have to be this way.

## What Makes MotherDuck Unique?

### The Old World

Bin-packed, high latency workloads

### Analytics are too cumbersome

With all your users in one big, shared box, they’re constantly competing for resources and compute, making load times unbearable...why are we doing this?

### Scaling is resource-intensive

With a traditional DWH, power users run into latency issues as processing scales. Deciding which users to bin-pack and which to isolate on their own instance is cumbersome and sloooooooow.

### No visibility of user-level usage

It’s impossible to understand who is driving the lion’s share of usage and how to prevent your database and the applications built on top from grinding to a halt.

The struggle is real - but there’s finally a better way.

### The MotherDuck World

Data warehouse without the overhead

### Simple, straightforward analytics

MotherDuck is the first analytics data warehouse that offers cloud scale and individualized, user-level tenancy. Managing user-level compute limits and cost attribution without cumbersome upfront configuration hasn’t been possible until now.

### The first truly personal data warehouse

Each user automatically gets their own compute instance “duckling” so end users can move quickly and freely from question to insight. Best of all: No more waiting around for queries to process because someone else is using too much compute!

### User-level CPU Visibility by design

Built-in user-level CPU visibility ensures a consistent, smooth experience for all your users. Cost attribution at the user-level helps you predict and proactively optimize costs without additional overhead - say goodbye to surprise bills when usage scales up.

## Dual Execution Query Engine

SUPPORT LOCAL ANALYTICS

Your MacBook is faster than a $20-60/hr data warehouse. Why is it acting like a dumb terminal for the mainframe-in-the-cloud? MotherDuck lets you repurpose unused compute on your machine for local analytics. Save the cloud for added scale when needed.

DOUBLE YOUR PROCESSING POWER

MotherDuck’s query planner routes execution plans where they can be completed quickly and efficiently. Queries can process on users’ local machines, in the cloud, or in a hybrid, dual fashion across both locations.

UNLOCK THE FREEDOM TO RUN ANYWHERE

DuckDB’s binary has the freedom to run anywhere, including in the web browser. With MotherDuck, DuckDB’s flexible query engine can finally be used by multiple users in production thanks to org-level sharing and collaboration.

EXTEND DUCKDB TO THE CLOUD

Develop locally and ship to production with the same, ultra-efficient database on the client and in the cloud. It’s simple, easy, efficient, and it just ducking works.

## FAQS

### How much does MotherDuck cost?

MotherDuck has a generous Free Plan for dabbling and experimenting with analytics.
For full details on our Pricing Plans, you can learn more [here](https://motherduck.com/pricing/).

### Can I use MotherDuck to query my data in S3?

Yes, MotherDuck plays well with AWS S3 as well as other object storage systems that are API-compatible with S3. Head over our documentation to learn how to [authenticate](https://motherduck.com/docs/integrations/cloud-storage/amazon-s3/) and [query](https://motherduck.com/docs/key-tasks/cloud-storage/querying-s3-files/) data in your S3-compatible data lake.

### Can I use something other than SQL to query MotherDuck?

There are multiple clients like [Golang](https://motherduck.com/docs/integrations/language-apis-and-drivers/go-driver/) or [Python](https://motherduck.com/docs/integrations/language-apis-and-drivers/python/python-overview/) supported by DuckDB that work out of the box with MotherDuck. You can also [use natural language with our AI Functions](https://motherduck.com/docs/key-tasks/writing-sql-with-ai/) to query your data.

### I use dbt. Can I use it with MotherDuck?
