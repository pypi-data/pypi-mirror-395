# Thomas (TFMV) McGeehan

Data architect & Technical writer

Tom is a data architect, technical writer, and open-source developer focused on simplifying data infrastructure and building systems that speak Apache Arrow natively. He's the creator of tools like Quiver (a hybrid vector database), Icebox (a single-binary Apache Iceberg playground), Resolve (a semantic entity resolution engine), and Hatch (a DuckDB-backed Flight SQL server). Thomas writes about modern data systems, edge computing, and the beauty of small, fast tools. His essays and technical deep dives are featured on Medium and LinkedIn, where he explores the intersection of code, architecture, and clarity.
