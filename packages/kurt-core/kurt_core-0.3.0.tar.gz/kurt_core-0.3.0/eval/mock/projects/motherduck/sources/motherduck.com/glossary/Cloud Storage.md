# cloud storage

_[Back to DuckDB Data Engineering Glossary](https://motherduck.com/glossary/)_

[Cloud storage](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is-cloud-storage/) refers to a model of data storage where digital information is saved on remote servers accessed through the internet, rather than on local hard drives or physical devices. This approach allows users and organizations to store, access, and manage their data from anywhere with an internet connection. Popular cloud storage providers include [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/), [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage), and [Microsoft Azure Blob Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/storage/blobs/). Cloud storage offers scalability, redundancy, and cost-effectiveness, as users can easily increase or decrease their storage capacity based on their needs. It also facilitates collaboration and data sharing among team members or across different applications. For data analysts and engineers, cloud storage serves as a crucial component of modern data architectures, enabling efficient data lakes, backup solutions, and integration with various data processing tools and services.
