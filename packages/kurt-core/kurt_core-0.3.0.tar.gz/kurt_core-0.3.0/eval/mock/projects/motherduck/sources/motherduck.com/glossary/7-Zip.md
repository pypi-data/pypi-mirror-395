# 7-Zip

_[Back to DuckDB Data Engineering Glossary](https://motherduck.com/glossary/)_

[7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) is a free and open-source file archiver and compression utility. It's widely used in data engineering workflows to compress large datasets or extract compressed files. 7-Zip supports a variety of archive formats, including its native .7z format, as well as common formats like ZIP, GZIP, and TAR. Data professionals often use 7-Zip to reduce file sizes for storage or transmission, and to unpack compressed data sources for analysis. The command-line version of 7-Zip is particularly useful for automating compression and decompression tasks in data pipelines. When working with DuckDB, you might use 7-Zip to compress exported data or decompress incoming datasets before ingestion.
