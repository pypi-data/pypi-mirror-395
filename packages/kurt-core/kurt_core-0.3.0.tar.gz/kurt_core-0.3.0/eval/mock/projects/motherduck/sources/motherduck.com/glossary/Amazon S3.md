# Amazon S3

_[Back to DuckDB Data Engineering Glossary](https://motherduck.com/glossary/)_

[Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) (Simple Storage Service) is a highly scalable, durable, and secure object storage service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It allows users to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web, making it ideal for a wide range of use cases including data lakes, websites, mobile applications, backup and restore, archive, and big data analytics. S3 organizes data into "buckets" which act as containers for objects (files), and each object is identified by a unique key within its bucket. The service offers various storage classes to optimize costs based on data access patterns, and integrates seamlessly with other AWS services and third-party tools. For data analysts and engineers, S3 often serves as a central repository for raw and processed data, enabling efficient data ingestion, transformation, and analysis workflows in conjunction with other data processing tools and services.
