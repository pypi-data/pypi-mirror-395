Meet **[Quack To SQL](https://motherduck.com/quacktosql/)**, the world’s _first_ AI model that lets you query your database by quacking. Yes, **literally quacking**. Powered by advanced duck-sound recognition, it runs locally in your browser—just like DuckDB.

No setup. No typing. Just pure, honking productivity.

Want the top 10 customers by revenue? Just quack it.

> 🧠 “But why?”
> 🦆 “Why not.”

Your browser does not support the video tag.

This is more than innovation—it’s inclusion. Billions of ducks have been ignored in the data space for too long. We’re changing that. (And yes, we’re working on sign-quack support for non-vocal ducks and humans too.)

To celebrate this milestone, we’re offering something special:

![duckets](https://motherduck.com/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmotherduck-com-web-prod.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fassets%2Fimg%2Fduckets_8548a88982.png&w=3840&q=75)

Every successful Quack To SQL user will earn **10 Duckets** — real, physical coins from our exclusive Physical Coin Offering (PCO). Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies, these coins come with **zero transaction fees** and **unlimited offline availability**—because sometimes, the best currency is the one you can actually hold.

So go ahead. Stop coding. Start [quacking](https://motherduck.com/quacktosql/).

Start using MotherDuck now!
