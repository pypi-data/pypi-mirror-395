We’re MotherDuck, a software company founded by a passionate flock of experienced data geeks. We’ve worked as leaders for some of the greatest companies in data: Snowflake, Databricks, AWS, Google BigQuery, Elastic, SingleStore, Meta. We now think it’s time to challenge the status quo.

We come together based on a set of shared beliefs:

- Scale out is expensive and slow. Let’s scale up.
- Big Data is dead. Long live easy data.
- Your laptop is faster than your data warehouse. Why wait for the cloud?
- DuckDB [slaps](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=slaps). Let’s supercharge it.

We’ve partnered with the amazing DuckDB team and community to build the Next New Thing™ in data.
