Moving to MotherDuck, a billed by-the-second cloud offering is a no-brainer for us, considering the elegance and efficiency of a single node system compared to traditional OLAP solutions.

MotherDuck is insanely performant, and there’s no infrastructure to manage. The cost of experimentation is incredibly low — which means we can afford to ask more questions and build more features, faster.

## Serverless Instances

MotherDuck’s [per-user tenancy model](https://motherduck.com/product/data-teams/) gives each Org member an isolated instance in one of five types to enable individual, user-level configuration.Multiple read scaling replicas can also be added to handle extra load from concurrent users.

![Pulse Instance type illustration](https://motherduck.com/_next/image/?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Finstance-type-illus-pulse.8c39b9cc.png&w=3840&q=75)

### Pulse

Our smallest instance, perfect for ad-hoc analytics tasks

Commonly used when...

- Doing ad-hoc analytics tasks with datasets in MotherDuck
- Building read-only workloads with high volumes of concurrent users like customer-facing analytics applications
- A larger, dedicated instance is overkill for the task at hand

Included Plans:

FreeLiteBusiness

![Standard Instance type illustration](https://motherduck.com/_next/image/?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Finstance-type-illus-standard.3d0ae9e9.png&w=3840&q=75)

### Standard

Built to handle common data warehouse workloads, including loads and transforms

Commonly used when...

- Performing typical data engineering tasks like data ingest and dbt transformations
- Running dbt jobs that have multiple transformations in parallel
- Building out standard data pipelines before moving to production and scaling up

Included Plans:

FreeLiteBusiness

![Jumbo Instance type illustration](https://motherduck.com/_next/image/?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Finstance-type-illus-jumbo.b77c7bca.png&w=3840&q=75)

### Jumbo

For larger data warehouse workloads with many transformations or complex aggregations

Commonly used when...

- Query complexity, data volume, and the number of transformations are too high for the Standard instance
- Performing complex joins and aggregations on growing datasets using event stream data or nested JSON with changing schemas
- Running faster with your workloads

Included Plans:

FreeLiteBusiness

And for even heavier workloads...

![Mega Instance type illustration](https://motherduck.com/_next/image/?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Finstance-type-illus-mega.cd4cd44f.png&w=3840&q=75)

### Mega

An extremely large instance for when you need complex transformations done quickly

Commonly used when...

- Queries are too complex or data volumes too high for Jumbo instances to handle in crunch time
- Running a weekly job that rebuilds all of your tables and it has to run in minutes, not hours
- One customer has 10x the amount of data as others and you want to deliver same speed

Included Plans:

FreeLiteBusiness

![Giga Instance type illustration](https://motherduck.com/_next/image/?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Finstance-type-illus-giga.3228dda6.png&w=3840&q=75)

### Giga

Largest instances enable the toughest transformations to run faster

Commonly used when...

- Your data workload is so complex that nothing else will work
- Running a one-time job to go back and restate revenue for the last 10 years at a large company
- You need a growth path beyond Mega for when your data volume and complexity grows 10x

## FAQS

### What is a MotherDuck Organization?

In MotherDuck, an Organization (Org for short) is a team of users. Each Org has member limits aligned to your pricing plan. Accounts for team members and service accounts will count towards the Org members included in your pricing plan.

### How does MotherDuck calculate and meter compute hours?

Depending on the Instance Type, MotherDuck meters compute on demand or per-instance.

The Pulse instance is an on-demand, auto-scaling instance that is metered on a per-query basis. We measure the amount of CPU and memory usage over time as a Compute Unit (CU). Pulse has a minimum of 1 CU second per query.

Standard, Jumbo, Mega, and Giga instances are metered per second an instance is running, with variable compute costs based on the pricing plan and selected Instance Type. They start up quickly, within ~200 ms, and continue running for 60 seconds once the last query completes.

Larger Mega and Giga instances take up to a few minutes to start up and have a cooldown period of 5 and 10 minutes, respectively.

### What is MotherDuck’s storage minimum, and how is it calculated and metered?

MotherDuck uses cloud object storage. Usage is metered on the size of compressed data stored on-disk.

To provide data recoverability, MotherDuck charges for 7 days’ worth of fail-safe data stored and meters on a per-day basis. Any data that is mutated or deleted will be retained for 7 days.

MotherDuck does not charge you for: Data managed by you in your own object storage bucket, data stored on your laptop, or MotherDuck-managed data used to provide zero-copy clones called [shares](https://motherduck.com/docs/key-tasks/sharing-data/sharing-overview/) and associated data sharing features.

### How are AI Units measured and metered?

1 AI Unit = $1.00

Please refer to the [Documentation](https://motherduck.com/docs/about-motherduck/billing/pricing/) for a detailed overview of how AI units burn down against [SQL Assistant](https://motherduck.com/docs/category/sql-assistant/) and [Bulk AI Functions](https://motherduck.com/docs/about-motherduck/billing/pricing/).

Paid Plan customers have full access to [FixIt](https://motherduck.com/docs/key-tasks/writing-sql-with-ai/#how-fixit-works), MotherDuck’s in-line suggestions to help resolve common SQL errors, and usage-based pricing for [SQL Assistant](https://motherduck.com/docs/category/sql-assistant/) and [Bulk AI Functions](https://motherduck.com/docs/about-motherduck/billing/pricing/).

Free Plan users have full access to [FixIt](https://motherduck.com/docs/key-tasks/writing-sql-with-ai/#how-fixit-works) and limited access to our [SQL Assistant Functions](https://motherduck.com/docs/category/sql-assistant/).

### In which cloud regions is MotherDuck available?

MotherDuck is currently available in the [AWS us-east-1 and AWS eu-central-1 regions](https://motherduck.com/docs/concepts/architecture-and-capabilities/). We have plans to expand to additional regions as part of our roadmap and encourage you to upvote ( [US-West](https://motherduck.canny.io/feature-requests/p/us-west-region)) or add other desired regions to [Canny](https://motherduck.canny.io/feature-requests).

### Can I use MotherDuck in two cloud regions simultaneously?

Each MotherDuck Organization is currently scoped to a single cloud region that must be chosen at Org creation when signing up.

### Is there an on-premises version of MotherDuck?

No - MotherDuck is a managed cloud service.

### Does MotherDuck have a free trial?

Every new account gets a free 21-day trial with full access to all of MotherDuck’s features. We also offer a Free Plan with 10 GB of storage and 10 Compute Unit (CU) hours per month.

### Does MotherDuck have an annual plan?

Yes - teams who are interested in an annual contract have the option to pre-commit to a level of MotherDuck usage. To learn more, please connect with our [Sales team](https://motherduck.com/contact-us/product-expert/).

### How does MotherDuck protect my data?

MotherDuck is committed to protecting customer data, honoring your global privacy rights, and securing the data you provide to us through the use of our products. We build our platform using best practices for highly available, scalable, and secure cloud applications, and we regularly monitor and assess our program to ensure that it meets or exceeds compliance and regulatory requirements.
