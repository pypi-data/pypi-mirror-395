# AI

_[Back to DuckDB Data Engineering Glossary](https://motherduck.com/glossary/)_

[Artificial Intelligence (AI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) refers to computer systems designed to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. For data analysts and engineers, AI often manifests as machine learning models that can analyze large datasets, make predictions, or generate content. In the context of data pipelines, AI can be used to automate data cleaning, enhance data quality, or provide insights through natural language processing. Tools like [OpenAI's GPT models](https://openai.com/gpt-4) or [Google's TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) enable data professionals to incorporate AI capabilities into their workflows, potentially revolutionizing how data is processed and interpreted. As AI continues to evolve, it's becoming an increasingly important skill for data practitioners to understand and leverage in their work.
