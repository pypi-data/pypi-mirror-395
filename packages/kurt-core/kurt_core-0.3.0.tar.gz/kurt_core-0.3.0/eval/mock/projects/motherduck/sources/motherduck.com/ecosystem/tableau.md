# Tableau

BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE

Tableau is a leading visual analytics platform that transforms data into actionable insights through interactive and shareable dashboards. It connects to various data sources, enabling users to create and distribute visualizations with ease. Tableau supports real-time collaboration and offers robust analytical capabilities for data discovery and storytelling.

## Tableau + MotherDuck

Tableau integrates with MotherDuck by allowing users to connect directly to their MotherDuck cloud data warehouse. This integration enables seamless data querying and visualization, leveraging DuckDB's efficient query engine for fast and interactive analytics. Data analysts, scientists, and engineers can thus utilize Tableau's powerful visualization tools to explore and present data stored in MotherDuck.

Tableau desktop, the on-premise hosted product and Tableau Cloud are all supported.
