# This Month in the DuckDB Ecosystem: March 2023

## Hey, friend 👋

Hi, I'm [Marcos](https://marcosortiz.carrd.co/)! I'm a data engineer by day at Riot Games (via X-Team). By night, I create newsletters for a few topics I'm passionate about: helping folks [find data digs](http://interestingdatagigs.substack.com/) and [AWS graviton](https://awsgravitonweekly.com/). After getting involved in the DuckDB community, I saw a great opportunity to partner with the MotherDuck team to share all the amazing things happening in the DuckDB ecosystem.

We hope you enjoy!

-Marcos
