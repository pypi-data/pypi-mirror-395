# Community Code of Conduct

## All are welcome.

We aim to create a safe space for all community members, regardless of age, race, gender, sexual orientation, physical appearance or disability, body size, religion, choice of data technologies, or any other distinguishing qualities.

**Be excellent to each other:** We will not tolerate behaviors that do not align with fundamental principles of respect, empathy, and openness towards others. We do not tolerate verbal or physical harassment, violence or intimidation, and expect the same of you. Please be kind and do the right thing.

We continuously strive to make our community a better place for everyone – in the best tradition of data people we "build, test, improve, and iterate." In this ongoing adventure, we rely on the support, courage, and creativity of all members of the data ecosystem to embody these principles.

If you are made uncomfortable in your role as MotherDuck community member, please let us know: You can reach us at [community@motherduck.com](mailto:community@motherduck.com). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The community team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
