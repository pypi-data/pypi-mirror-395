### Global team

MotherDuck is a globally distributed team stretching from Seattle to Amsterdam. This has enabled us to hire the strongest talent across infrastructure engineering, frontend engineering, go-to-market, design and company leadership - regardless of where they live.

### Quacking together

Even though our team is spread out all over the world, we've established hubs in Seattle, San Francisco, New York and Amsterdam where we collaborate in person. And every few months the company hosts an offsite to share ideas, have fun, and build the future of MotherDuck - the product and the company. It's always a blast!

## Our Culture

![YouTube video preview](https://motherduck.com/_next/image/?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Four-culture-thumbnail.befc399e.png&w=3840&q=75)

## Our Values

![Flexibility illustration](https://motherduck.com/_next/image/?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fvalues-flexibility.20bc8d68.png&w=3840&q=75)

#### Flexibility

At MotherDuck, Flexibility means adaptability, openness to diverse perspectives, and turning challenges into opportunities. We embrace the best ideas regardless of origin, transform obstacles into advantages, and use new information to recalibrate. Flexibility is about finding the most effective way forward, without wasting opportunities to innovate.

![Thoughtfulness illustration](https://motherduck.com/_next/image/?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fvalues-thoughtfulness.71464f18.png&w=3840&q=75)

#### Thoughtfulness

At MotherDuck, We believe that in order to move fast it is important to take a moment and figure out where we want to be headed; after all, velocity implies both speed and direction. Thoughtfulness is about bringing others along; demonstrating care and respect for our coworkers and customers in pursuit of our shared goals.

![Unorthodoxy illustration](https://motherduck.com/_next/image/?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fvalues-unorthodoxy.43f66e63.png&w=3840&q=75)

#### Unorthodoxy

At MotherDuck, Unorthodoxy means thinking boldly and operating with conviction. We challenge norms, embrace playful experimentation, and trust in our beliefs to drive innovation. By fostering connection and the clash of diverse ideas, we create solutions that no one has seen before. Unorthodoxy is about standing out, staying creative, and pushing boundaries to make a meaningful impact.

![Agency illustration](https://motherduck.com/_next/image/?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fvalues-agency.55d6c17a.png&w=3840&q=75)

#### Agency

At MotherDuck, Agency means ownership of outcomes. Challenges and roadblocks don't stop us, they are opportunities to find solutions (see 'Flexibility' and 'Unorthodoxy'). Agency also embodies empowerment, trusting individuals to make decisions and take action necessary to thoroughly remove problems.

I've worked in great teams and with amazing people in my career, but MotherDuck is special in that everyone, absolutely everyone shares their knowledge, time and energy freely. The technology is fun, too, of course - we have many interesting problems to solve - but it's the way we come together to troubleshoot user issues, unblock local setup problems and support each other through frustrating moments that allowed this duck-shaped startup to build so quickly.

It has been such a thrill to join MotherDuck! This technology will truly improve the lives of data folks. There are so many innovative directions to explore that completely change the game! I am learning every single day from the incredibly talented folks around me. I’ve gotten so much help whenever I’ve needed it. Everyone has an owner mindset - no fiefdoms, just collaboration! DuckDB truly is the friendly database, and we take that to 11 at MotherDuck.

Working on bringing a new cloud database to life is a rare opportunity. This has only happened a handful of times over the last 2 decades, but it's happening here, and you couldn't gather a better group together for it. With our DuckDB Foundation partnership, we have close links to one of the best academic database research teams in the world, and the time from best practice discovery to implementation is measured in weeks, not years. Our user base is fantastic and supportive. I cannot think of a better place and time to try to make a contribution to a field which affects so many.

Alex Monahan

FD Engineer at MotherDuck

It has been such a thrill to join MotherDuck! This technology will truly improve the lives of data folks. There are so many innovative directions to explore that completely change the game! I am learning every single day from the incredibly talented folks around me. I’ve gotten so much help whenever I’ve needed it. Everyone has an owner mindset - no fiefdoms, just collaboration! DuckDB truly is the friendly database, and we take that to 11 at MotherDuck.

Working on bringing a new cloud database to life is a rare opportunity. This has only happened a handful of times over the last 2 decades, but it's happening here, and you couldn't gather a better group together for it. With our DuckDB Foundation partnership, we have close links to one of the best academic database research teams in the world, and the time from best practice discovery to implementation is measured in weeks, not years. Our user base is fantastic and supportive. I cannot think of a better place and time to try to make a contribution to a field which affects so many.

I've worked in great teams and with amazing people in my career, but MotherDuck is special in that everyone, absolutely everyone shares their knowledge, time and energy freely. The technology is fun, too, of course - we have many interesting problems to solve - but it's the way we come together to troubleshoot user issues, unblock local setup problems and support each other through frustrating moments that allowed this duck-shaped startup to build so quickly.
