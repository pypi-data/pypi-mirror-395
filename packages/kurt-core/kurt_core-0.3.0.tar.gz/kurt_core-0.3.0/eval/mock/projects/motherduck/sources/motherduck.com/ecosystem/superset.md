# Superset

BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE

Apache Superset is an open-source data exploration and visualization platform designed for modern data teams. It offers a rich set of data visualization capabilities, a user-friendly interface, and robust integration options for various data sources. Superset allows users to create and share dashboards, run SQL queries, and gain insights from their data in real-time.

## Superset + MotherDuck

Superset integrates with MotherDuck by connecting to it as a SQL-based data source. Users can configure Superset to query data stored in MotherDuck's cloud data warehouse, leveraging DuckDB's efficient query processing engine. This integration enables seamless data visualization and exploration directly from MotherDuck within the Superset interface.

MotherDuck also supports Preset, which is a commercial cloud platform based on the Apache Superset open source project.
