# Python

[Back to DuckDB Data Engineering Glossary](https://motherduck.com/glossary/)

[Python](https://www.python.org/) is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It has become a cornerstone in the modern data stack, widely used by data analysts and engineers for tasks ranging from data manipulation to machine learning. Python's extensive ecosystem of libraries, such as [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) for data analysis, [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) for numerical computing, and [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) for machine learning, make it a versatile tool for various data-related tasks. Its syntax emphasizes code readability, making it an excellent choice for beginners and experienced programmers alike. Python's ability to integrate with other languages and tools, including SQL databases like DuckDB, further enhances its utility in data workflows. Many data professionals use Python in conjunction with Jupyter notebooks for interactive data exploration and visualization, solidifying its position as a key component in the modern data analyst's toolkit.
