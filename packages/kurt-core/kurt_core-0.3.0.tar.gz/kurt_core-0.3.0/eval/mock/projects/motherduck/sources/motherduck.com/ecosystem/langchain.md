# LangChain

DATA SCIENCE & AI

LangChain is a framework designed to facilitate the development of applications leveraging large language models (LLMs). It provides tools for building, managing, and deploying LLM-powered applications, enabling seamless integration with various data sources and workflows. LangChain supports features such as prompt management, model evaluation, and API connectivity to streamline the development process for data-driven applications.

## LangChain + MotherDuck

LangChain integrates with MotherDuck to enable seamless interaction between LLM-powered applications and the cloud data warehouse capabilities of MotherDuck. By leveraging DuckDB's efficient in-process querying and MotherDuck's scalable cloud infrastructure, LangChain applications can perform complex data manipulations and analytics in real-time. This integration ensures that data scientists and analysts can harness the power of LLMs while maintaining robust, scalable, and efficient data workflows.
