# Datagrip

DEV TOOLS

DataGrip is a powerful database management tool developed by JetBrains, designed for SQL developers. It provides intelligent query completion, robust code analysis, and refactoring capabilities, supporting various databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle. DataGrip offers a unified interface, enabling users to manage and explore databases efficiently.

## DataGrip + MotherDuck

DataGrip integrates with MotherDuck by leveraging its JDBC connector to connect to the MotherDuck cloud data warehouse. This enables users to execute queries, manage schemas, and analyze data stored in MotherDuck directly from the DataGrip interface.
