DATA SCIENCE & AI

marimo is a reactive notebook for Python and SQL that models notebooks as dataflow graphs. When you run a cell or interact with a UI element, marimo automatically runs affected cells (or marks them as stale), keeping code and outputs consistent and preventing bugs before they happen. Every marimo notebook is stored as pure Python, executable as a script, and deployable as an app.

## marimo + MotherDuck

marimo integrates with MotherDuck to provide an interactive and seamless data analysis experience. Users can connect directly to their MotherDuck data warehouse using marimo's SQL cells or using the DuckDB Python API, allowing them to:

- Create dynamic visualizations of data stored in MotherDuck using marimo with your favorite plotting library for Python
- Leverage marimo's reactive execution to automatically keep queries and visualizations up to date
- Build interactive dashboards and apps that query MotherDuck data in real-time
- Mix-and-match Python and SQL to perform complex data transformations on MotherDuck tables
- Use AI to generate SQL queries and visualizations of your MotherDuck tables

The integration enables data scientists and analysts to create reproducible, interactive data workflows that scale seamlessly from local development to production deployments. marimo's dataflow graph ensures data consistency while MotherDuck provides enterprise-grade data storage and querying capabilities.
