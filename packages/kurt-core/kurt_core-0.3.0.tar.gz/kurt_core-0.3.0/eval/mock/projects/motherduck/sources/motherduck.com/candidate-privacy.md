## Legal Bases for Processing European Personal Information

If you are located in the European Economic Area ( **“EEA”**) or the United Kingdom ( **“UK”**), we only process your Personal Information when we have a valid “legal basis.” The bases on which we may collect and process your Personal Information include:

- **Consent.** You have consented to our processing of your Personal Information to manage and assess your application.
- **Contract Performance.** We need to process your Personal Information to take steps to enter into a contract with you.
- **Compliance.** MotherDuck’s legal obligations.

MotherDuck does not collect or otherwise process special categories of Personal Information (which may include information about your racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, criminal records, criminal proceedings, or health or sex life), except where:


- The processing is required or permitted by applicable law;
- The processing is required to conduct a background check;
- The processing is necessary for the purposes of carrying out our obligations and exercising specific rights; or
- MotherDuck has, to the extent permitted by applicable law, obtained your explicit consent to process such information.

### How We Disclose the Personal Information We Collect

- **MotherDuck Personnel.** Access to, use of and other processing of Personal Information generally will be limited to individuals who have a need to know the information for the purposes described in this Notice, which may include your potential managers or supervisors, as well as personnel in HR, IT, Compliance, Legal, Finance and Accounting, and Internal Audit. Most personnel within MotherDuck will have access to your business contact information such as name, position, telephone number, work address, and email address.
- **Third Parties and Service Providers.** From time to time, MotherDuck may make Personal Information available to other entities, such as legal and regulatory authorities, outside professional advisors, and service providers (such as providers of human resources services, IT systems and support, cloud storage providers, and other third parties engaged to assist MotherDuck in carrying out business activities).
- **As Required by Law.** We also may disclose Personal Information to third parties other than service providers: (i) if we are required to do so by law, regulation, or legal process (such as a court order or subpoena), (ii) in response to requests by government agencies, or (iii) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity.
- **Affiliates and Business Transactions.** MotherDuck may disclose your Personal Information to MotherDuck affiliates to fulfil the purposes described in this Notice. We may also transfer your Personal Information in the event that we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets (including in the event of a reorganization, dissolution, or liquidation). Some of these transfers may be to parties in countries outside of the country and region in which you work.

### Cross-Border Data Transfers

MotherDuck may transfer your Personal Information to locations in the United States and other countries that have different data protection laws than those in the country in which you are based or work and that may not provide the same level of protection for your Personal Information, including to countries that have not been found to provide adequate protection by the European Commission or by the UK Government, as appropriate.

Please note that by submitting your application, you are transferring your Personal Information to the United States, where MotherDuck is based.

### Information Security and Integrity

We have in place appropriate legal, organizational, physical and technical measures that are designed to improve the integrity and security of Personal Information that we collect and maintain and to protect Personal Information in conformity with applicable privacy and data security laws. As required by applicable law, when MotherDuck retains a third-party service provider, that provider will be required to use measures to protect the confidentiality and security of the Personal Information and process the Personal Information only as directed by MotherDuck.

To the extent required by applicable law, we take reasonable steps to ensure that the Personal Information we process is reliable for its intended use, is accurate, up-to-date and complete, and is limited to the Personal Information required to carry out the purposes of the processing, as described in this Notice.

### Data Retention

We will retain your Personal Information only for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in this Notice unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by applicable law. When determining the retention period, MotherDuck considers various criteria, such as the services offered by you, mandatory retention periods provided by law, and the relevant statute of limitations.
