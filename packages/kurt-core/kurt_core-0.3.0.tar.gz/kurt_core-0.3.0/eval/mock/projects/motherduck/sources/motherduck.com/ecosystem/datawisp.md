# Datawisp

BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE

Datawisp is a no code analytics platform that lets anyone analyze data and discover insights regardless of their technical knowledge. Its node-based interface allows users to combine different “blocks” to transform data, much like a developer would with code. Each block performs a different operation, such as filtering, sorting, or creating a chart, and linking even 3 or 4 of these blocks can transform and analyze data in powerful ways.

Datawisp also features an AI-powered assistant, named Wispy, that takes natural language input from the user and automatically creates charts, tables, and more. Worksheets created by Wispy can be used as-is or can be subsequently edited manually by anyone with some knowledge of how blocks work.

Datawisp runs in a browser and lets users collaborate in real time and share their work with both internal and external audiences.
