## [Building Local and Serverless ELT(ETL) pipelines with CloudQuery and MotherDuck](https://www.cloudquery.io/blog/building-local-and-serverless-elt-cq-and-md)

In this blog post we will walk through building an ELT pipeline using CloudQuery and DuckDB locally and then how to run the same configuration and pipeline with CloudQuery Cloud and MotherDuck (DuckDB Cloud version).

One cool thing about CloudQuery and DuckDB is that both of them are very easy to run locally which makes it easy to develop and debug before running in the cloud which can save time on feedback loops and surging cloud costs of compute, data, and egress - especially for development purposes.
