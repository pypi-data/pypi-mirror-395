“At Wilde we predict our clients' future LTV so they can make informed decisions on how to operate their business. Motherduck is a pivotal part of both our data stack, and our web app. We serve our predictions up with a single-tier data architecture directly with MotherDuck.

### Simple, Straightforward Analytics

MotherDuck is the first analytics data warehouse that offers cloud scale and individualized, user-level tenancy. Managing user-level compute limits and cost attribution without cumbersome upfront configuration hasn’t been possible until now.

![The First Truly Personal Data Warehouse](https://motherduck.com/_next/image/?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fstart-up-first.35974bcd.png&w=3840&q=75)

### The First Truly Personal Data Warehouse

Each user automatically gets their own compute instance “duckling” so end users can move quickly and freely from question to insight. Best of all: No more waiting around for queries to process because someone else is using too much compute!

![User-level CPU Visibility by design](https://motherduck.com/_next/image/?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fstart-up-user-level.c5612cfd.png&w=3840&q=75)

### User-level CPU Visibility by design

Built-in user-level CPU visibility ensures a consistent, smooth experience for all your users. Cost attribution at the user-level helps you predict and proactively optimize costs without additional overhead - say goodbye to surprise bills when usage scales up.

### Modern Duck Stack

MotherDuck works out of the box with 50+ leading data tools, allowing you to deploy quickly and future-proof your data stack.

## Zero latency, in-browser analytics on DuckDB in the cloud

We already do everything in the browser. Why not analytics? The bar for in-app analytics experiences has never been higher! Data-driven decision making is essential, and high-latency, static dashboards don’t meet user needs.

Using the power of DuckDB, MotherDuck helps developers build warp speed, responsive data experiences that run in the browser and the cloud.
