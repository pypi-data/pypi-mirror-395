# Online Analytical Processing (OLAP)

_[Back to DuckDB Data Engineering Glossary](https://motherduck.com/glossary/)_

Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) is a computing approach designed for efficiently analyzing large volumes of multidimensional data from various perspectives. Unlike traditional Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) systems that handle day-to-day operations, OLAP systems are optimized for complex queries and data aggregations across multiple dimensions. These systems allow users to slice and dice data, perform drill-down and roll-up operations, and create pivot tables to gain insights from historical data. OLAP is particularly useful for business intelligence, financial reporting, and trend analysis. Modern OLAP solutions, such as [Apache Druid](https://druid.apache.org/) or [ClickHouse](https://clickhouse.com/), can handle massive datasets and provide near real-time analytics capabilities. In the context of DuckDB, while it's not a traditional OLAP system, it offers OLAP-like functionality with its columnar storage engine and ability to efficiently process analytical queries on large datasets.
