# Polytomic

INGESTION

REVERSE ETL

Polytomic is a single platform for moving data in both directions between data warehouses, databases, SaaS applications like Salesforce, spreadsheets, cloud storage buckets like S3, and arbitrary HTTP APIs.

ELT, ETL, CDC streaming, and Reverse ETL workloads are all reliably and scalably supported through both an intuitive no-code interface as well as a full API (with Terraform support).

Polytomic can be accessed either through the cloud version or a self-hosted version using Docker.

Polytomic’s sync engine can also be embedded in your products using Polytomic Connect, the white label sync API.

## Polytomic + MotherDuck

Polytomic can sync data with MotherDuck in both directions:

- Sync from other databases (e.g. PostgreSQL) into MotherDuck (high-scale CDC streaming supported too).
- Sync from SaaS applications like Stripe, Zendesk, Salesforce, and others into MotherDuck
- Sync from MotherDuck into SaaS applications like Salesforce, HubSpot, Zendesk, and others.
- Sync in both directions between spreadsheets (e.g. Google Sheets, Airtable) and MotherDuck.
