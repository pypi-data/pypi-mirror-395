DATA QUALITY

Bruin is an end-to-end data platform that brings together data ingestion, transformation using SQL and Python, data quality and governance.

- Ingestion: You can ingest data from a variety of sources such as databases, marketing platforms, CRM tools, and more.
- Transformation: You can transform your data inside the data warehouse using SQL and Python. Built-in materialization strategies, incremental processing, Jinja templating, and more.
- Data Quality: Bruin allows you to ensure your data is accurate on a regular basis, whether it comes in externally or you built it. You can run column-level and custom quality checks, track the distribution of your data, run cross-table quality checks, and get alerts automatically.
- Data Governance: Bruin allows scaling your data infrastructure via built-in governance reports, glossaries, metadata policies, cost reports, and more. You can run all Bruin checks in your CI/CD pipelines, ensuring your data pipelines always fit what you expect.
