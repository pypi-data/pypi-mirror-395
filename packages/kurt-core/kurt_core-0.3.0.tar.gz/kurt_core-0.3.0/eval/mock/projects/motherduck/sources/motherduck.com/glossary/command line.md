# command line

_[Back to DuckDB Data Engineering Glossary](https://motherduck.com/glossary/)_

The command line, also known as the terminal or shell, is a text-based interface for interacting with a computer's operating system. It allows users to execute commands, navigate file systems, and perform various tasks without a graphical user interface. For data analysts and engineers, the command line is an essential tool for tasks like running scripts, managing databases, and automating workflows. Popular command line interfaces include Bash on Unix-based systems and PowerShell on Windows. Proficiency in command line usage is crucial for working with data tools, version control systems like [Git](https://git-scm.com/), and cloud platforms. Many data processing tools, including DuckDB, offer command line interfaces for quick data exploration and analysis.
