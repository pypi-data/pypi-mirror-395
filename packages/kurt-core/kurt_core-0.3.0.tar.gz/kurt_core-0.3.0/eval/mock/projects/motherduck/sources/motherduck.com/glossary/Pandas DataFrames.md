# Pandas DataFrames

_[Back to DuckDB Data Engineering Glossary](https://motherduck.com/glossary/)_

[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) DataFrames are versatile, two-dimensional labeled data structures in Python that can hold various types of data. They serve as a fundamental building block for data manipulation and analysis tasks. DataFrames organize data into rows and columns, similar to a spreadsheet or SQL table, allowing for efficient indexing, slicing, and aggregation operations. With Pandas, you can easily load data from various sources like CSV files, databases, or APIs, and perform complex transformations using intuitive methods. DataFrames support handling of missing data, merging and joining datasets, and applying functions across rows or columns. Their integration with other popular data science libraries like NumPy and Matplotlib makes Pandas DataFrames an essential tool for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and feature engineering in the data analytics workflow.
