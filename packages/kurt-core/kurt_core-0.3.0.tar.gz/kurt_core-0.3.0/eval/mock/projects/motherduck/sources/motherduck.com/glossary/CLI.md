# CLI

_[Back to DuckDB Data Engineering Glossary](https://motherduck.com/glossary/)_

The CLI, or Command-Line Interface, is a text-based interface used to interact with computer programs and operating systems through typed commands. For data professionals, the CLI is an essential tool for efficient data manipulation, analysis, and system management. Many popular data tools, including [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/), offer CLI versions that allow users to execute queries, manage databases, and perform various operations without the need for a graphical user interface.

Using a CLI often provides faster performance and greater flexibility compared to GUI-based alternatives. It also enables easy automation of repetitive tasks through scripts and batch processing. For example, in DuckDB's CLI, you can execute SQL queries directly:

```sql
Copy code

SELECT * FROM my_table LIMIT 5;
```

Or import data from a CSV file:

```sql
Copy code

.import csv my_data.csv
```

Mastering the CLI is a valuable skill for data analysts and engineers, as it enhances productivity and provides deeper control over data processing tasks.
