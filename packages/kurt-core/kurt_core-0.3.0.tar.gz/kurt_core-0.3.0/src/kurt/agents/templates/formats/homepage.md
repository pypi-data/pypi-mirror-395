## Customizing This Template (One-Time Setup)

**When to customize:** First time writing homepage for this company

**Goal:** Fill in "[CUSTOMIZATION NEEDED]" section with company's homepage style

### Step 1: Get Current Homepage

```bash
# Find homepage
kurt content list --url-starts-with https://<company-domain> | head -1

# If not fetched:
kurt content fetch https://<company-domain>
```

### Step 2: Analyze Current Homepage (And Competitor References)

**Read current homepage:**
```bash
kurt content get <homepage-doc-id>
```

**Optional - analyze 2-3 competitor homepages:**
```bash
kurt content fetch https://<competitor1.com>
kurt content fetch https://<competitor2.com>
```

**Maximum: 1 current + 2-3 competitors = 4 examples total**

### Step 3: Analyze Structure and Style

**Note these patterns:**

**Hero message:**
- What's the primary claim? (outcome, capability, audience)
- How specific vs abstract?
- Copy exact hero text

**Information architecture:**
- What sections appear? (products, solutions, customers, company)
- In what order?
- How deep does each go?

**Value proposition:**
- Outcome-driven ("Grow revenue") or capability-driven ("The best platform")?
- How much proof immediately visible?
- Copy value prop section

**Tone:**
- Formality 1-10
- Speak to specific segment or everyone?
- Technical or business language?

**DO/DON'T Examples:**
- Find 2-3 sections showing best homepage style
- Write contrasting examples
- Note what they avoid (too technical, too vague, wrong audience)

**Navigation:**
- What are primary CTAs?
- How many CTAs total?
- What's the hierarchy?

**Social proof:**
- Customer logos prominent or subtle?
- Testimonials, metrics, or case studies?
- Where placed?

### Troubleshooting

**Homepage is very complex/long?**
- Focus on above-the-fold and first 3 sections
- Ask user: "Your homepage has many sections. Which are most important to match in style?"

**Homepage is very simple?**
- Note minimalist approach
- Ask user: "Your current homepage is quite minimal. Is that intentional or should the new one be more comprehensive?"

**Need positioning materials?**
- Ask user: "I need core positioning/value prop. Can you provide:
  - Mission/vision statement
  - Product positioning docs
  - Key messaging guidelines"

**Need product information?**
- Ask user: "What products/solutions should appear on homepage? Please provide:
  - Product names and brief descriptions
  - Priority order
  - Key differentiators"

**Missing customer proof?**
- Ask user: "I need social proof. Can you provide:
  - Customer logos (who can we show?)
  - Testimonial quotes
  - Key metrics or case studies
  - Notable customer wins"
