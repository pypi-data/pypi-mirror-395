   - Feature specs, documentation, product briefs
   - Documentation pages

3. **User impact** - Why users should care
   - Product manager notes, user research, feedback

**Note**: Use kurt CLI research commands for external research. See rule files (@find-sources) for discovery methods.

## Source Requirements

**Before writing, gather these sources (documented in plan.md):**

**Recent changes:**
