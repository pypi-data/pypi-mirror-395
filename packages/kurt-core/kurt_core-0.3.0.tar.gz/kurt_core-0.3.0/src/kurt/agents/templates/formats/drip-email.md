- Update status to `draft`
- Ensure emails build on each other
- Balance education vs pitch (more education early)
- Match company's drip style
- Reference sources: `<!-- Source: /path -->`

**Step 3: Sequence coherence check**
- Does each email reference the previous?

## Customizing This Template (One-Time Setup)

**When to customize:** First time writing drip sequence for this company

**Goal:** Fill in "[CUSTOMIZATION NEEDED]" section with company's drip email style

### Step 1: Get Company's Drip Sequences

**Ask user for examples:**
"I need to see an existing drip email sequence from [company] to match your style. Can you:
- Forward a complete sequence (or multiple emails from same sequence)
- Export from your email platform (Mailchimp, HubSpot, etc.)
- Paste the email content

How many emails are typically in your sequences?"

**Cannot scrape:** Drip emails not in public database - user must provide

### Step 2: Collect Full Sequence (Iterative with User)

**Ask user:**
"Please share a complete drip email sequence (ideally 3-7 emails). I need to see:
- All emails in order
- Subject lines
- Timing between emails
- How they build on each other

If you have multiple sequences, share the one that performs best."

**Save provided emails:**
- As: `projects/<project>/style-examples/drip-sequence-1/email-1.txt`
- As: `projects/<project>/style-examples/drip-sequence-1/email-2.txt`
- etc.

**Maximum: 2-3 full sequences to analyze**

### Step 3: Analyze Sequence

**For the sequence, note:**

**Sequence philosophy:**
- What's the approach? (education-first, value ladder, problem-solution)
- How do emails build on each other?
- Education vs pitch ratio by email?

**Subject lines:**
- Pattern throughout sequence?
- Do they create continuity/curiosity?
- Copy all subject lines in order

**Opening style:**
- How do they start each email?
- Do they reference previous emails?
- Copy opening from each email

**Email pacing:**
- How long is each email? (word count)
- How much value vs pitch in each?
- How many paragraphs/structure?

**Tone:**
- Formality 1-10
- Personal ("I") or company ("we")?
- Does tone evolve through sequence?

**DO/DON'T Examples:**
- Find 2-3 email excerpts showing best drip style
- Write contrasting examples
- Note what they avoid

**CTA evolution:**
- How does CTA change email to email?
- Copy CTAs from each email
- When do they make the ask?

**Personalization:**
- What's personalized beyond {{FirstName}}?
- Behavior-triggered or time-based?

**Timing:**
- Days between each email?
- Why that spacing?

### Step 4: Update Style Guidelines Section

**Edit this template file and replace "[CUSTOMIZATION NEEDED]":**

```markdown

### Troubleshooting

**Don't have drip sequences yet?**
- Ask user: "You don't have drip sequences yet. What's the goal?
  - Nurture free trial users to paid?
  - Onboard new customers?
  - Convert leads to demo?
  - This helps me structure the sequence."

**Only have one-off marketing emails?**
- Explain: "Drip sequences are different from one-off emails. They're a series that builds over time."
- Offer: "Want me to create a new sequence structure, or adapt your one-off email style?"

**Need journey stage info?**
- Ask user: "I need to understand your customer journey. Can you provide:
  - What do recipients know when they enter this sequence?
  - What needs to happen before they convert?
  - What are common objections or questions?
  - What proof points matter most?"

**Missing educational content?**
- Ask user: "What helpful resources should I include early in sequence? Looking for:
  - Blog posts
  - How-to guides
  - Industry insights
  - Quick wins they can implement"
