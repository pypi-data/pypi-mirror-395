kurt content search "positioning"

kurt content search "persona"
kurt content search "audience"

Or search for campaign retrospectives:
```bash
kurt content search "campaign"
kurt content search "retrospective"
```

**Step 4: Inventory Existing Content (30 min)**

```bash
# Discover what content pages exist
kurt content list --url-contains /blog/

# Search for content types
kurt content search "case study"
kurt content search "guide"
kurt content search "whitepaper"

# Check if similar campaigns have been run
kurt content search "[campaign-topic]"
```

**Step 5: Plan Content Gaps (1 hour)**

Based on:
