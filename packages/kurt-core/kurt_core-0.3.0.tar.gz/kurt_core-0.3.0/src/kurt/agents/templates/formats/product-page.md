## Research Requirements

**Types of information needed for product pages:**

1. **Product capabilities** - Features, specs, technical details
   - Product specs, feature lists, technical documentation

2. **Competitive differentiation** - How you compare to alternatives
   - Competitive analysis docs, positioning materials
   - Comparison with alternatives

3. **Customer proof** - Testimonials, case studies, metrics
   - Customer interview notes, success metrics, testimonials
   - Case studies

4. **Use cases** - How customers use this product
   - Sales notes, customer stories, implementation examples

**Note**: Use kurt CLI research commands for external research. See @find-sources rule for discovery methods and @add-source rule for ingestion.

---

## Source Requirements

**Before writing, gather these sources (documented in plan.md):**

**Product information:**
- Product documentation, feature lists
- Technical specifications
- Product pages, feature pages

**Customer proof:**
- Customer testimonials, case studies
- Success metrics, customer stories

**Competitive information:**
- Competitive analysis
- Comparison materials

**Note**: Use kurt CLI to discover and fetch sources. See rule files (@find-sources, @add-source) for methods. All sources should be documented in plan.md "Sources of Ground Truth" section.

### Discovery Using URL Patterns (If Not Clustered)

**Product documentation:**
```bash
# Search for product features and capabilities
kurt content list --url-contains /product | grep -i "<product-name>"
kurt content list --url-contains /features
kurt content list --url-contains /docs/ | grep -i "<product-name>"

# If not fetched:
kurt content fetch --urls "<product-doc-url>"
```

**Pricing/plans info:**
```bash
kurt content list --url-contains /pricing
```

**Customer evidence:**
```bash
kurt content list --url-contains /customer
kurt content list --url-contains /testimon
```

**If no clusters exist yet:**
```bash
# Cluster existing content to organize by topic
kurt content cluster --include "*example.com*"
```

**If insufficient sources: Ask user for product specs, competitive positioning, or customer proof**

## Customizing This Template (One-Time Setup)

**When to customize:** First time writing a product page for this company

**Goal:** Fill in "[CUSTOMIZATION NEEDED]" section with company's actual product page style

### Step 1: Find Company's Product Pages

```bash
# Search for product pages
kurt content list --url-contains /product
kurt content list --url-contains /solutions
kurt content list --url-contains /features

# Check homepage (often similar style)
kurt content list --url-starts-with https://<company-domain> | head -5
```

**If NOT_FETCHED:**
```bash
kurt content fetch --include "*/product/*" --limit 5
```

### Step 2: Select 3-5 Examples (Iterative with User)

**Offer suggestions:**
"I found these product/marketing pages for style analysis:
1. [URL + title]
2. [URL + title]
3. [URL + title]
4. [URL + title]
5. [URL + title]

Use these, or provide different URLs?"

**Maximum: 5 examples**

### Step 3: Analyze Examples

```bash
# Read pages
kurt content get <doc-id-1>
kurt content get <doc-id-2>
```

**Note these patterns:**

**Headlines:**
- Benefit-driven ("Grow revenue faster") or feature-name ("Acme Payment Platform")?
- Include outcome or just describe product?
- Copy 2-3 headlines

**Value proposition:**
- Concrete outcomes with numbers, or abstract benefits?
- How much explanation before showing product?
- Copy actual value prop section

**Feature descriptions:**
- Just headlines + bullets, or paragraph explanations?
- How technical? Developer features or business benefits?
- Copy example feature section

**Tone:**
- Formality 1-10
- "We help you" vs "You can" vs neutral
- Bold claims or modest/data-backed?

**DO/DON'T Examples:**
- Find 2-3 sentences that exemplify their best style
- Write contrasting examples of what they avoid
- Note why (too salesy, too technical, too vague, etc.)

**Social proof:**
- Customer logos, testimonial quotes, metrics, case studies?
- Where placed? (top, scattered, bottom)
- Copy how they present proof

**CTAs:**
- What's primary action? (Start free trial, Request demo, Contact sales)
- Secondary option? (Watch video, Read docs)
- Copy exact CTA text

### Step 4: Update Style Guidelines Section

**Edit this template file and replace "[CUSTOMIZATION NEEDED]":**

```markdown
## Style Guidelines

**Hero/Headline:**
- Pattern: [observed pattern]
- Examples: "[headline 1]", "[headline 2]"

**Value Proposition:**
- Style: [their approach]

- Format: [their format]
- Technical depth: [level]
- Example: "[copy section]"

**Tone:**
- Formality: [X/10]
- Voice: [we / you / neutral]
- Confidence level: [assertive / modest / data-driven]

**DO/DON'T Examples (from their actual pages):**

✅ **DO:** "[Copy exemplary sentences]"

❌ **DON'T:** "[Contrasting example]"
- Reason: [why they avoid this]

✅ **DO:** "[Another good example]"

❌ **DON'T:** "[Another contrasting example]"
- Reason: [why they avoid this]

**Social Proof:**
- Style: [their approach]
- Placement: [where it appears]

**CTAs:**
- Primary: "[their CTA]"
- Secondary: "[alternative]"
- Placement: [where they appear]
```

**Save the updated template file**

### Troubleshooting

**Can't find product pages?**
- Check: `kurt content stats`
- Try: Homepage or main marketing pages
- Ask user: "I don't see product pages. Can you provide 3-5 URLs?"

**Pages are very different from each other?**
- Look for common elements (CTAs, proof style, tone)
- Ask user: "Style varies. Which page best represents the voice you want?"

**Need product specs?**
- Ask user: "I need product capabilities and features. Can you provide documentation or a feature list?"

**Missing customer proof?**
- Ask user: "Do you have customer testimonials, case studies, or success metrics to include?"
