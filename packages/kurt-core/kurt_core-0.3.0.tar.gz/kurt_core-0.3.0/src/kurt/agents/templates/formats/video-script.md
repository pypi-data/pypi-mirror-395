## Tips for Effective Video Scripts

**Hook viewers fast:**
- First 3-5 seconds are critical
- Start with question, bold claim, or relatable problem
- Don't waste time with long intros

**Show, don't just tell:**
- Demonstrate features in action
- Use real examples, not placeholders
- Show outcomes, not just features

**Keep it conversational:**
- Write how you speak, not how you write
- Read script aloud to catch awkward phrasing
- Use contractions, simple words

**Match visuals to audio:**
- What you show should match what you say
- Time captions to sync with visuals
- Don't show complex visual while explaining something else

**Include captions:**
- Most social videos watched muted
- Captions increase completion rate
- Make text legible and concise

**End with clear CTA:**
- One specific action
- Make it easy (free trial, visit website)
- Repeat URL or CTA verbally and visually
