# The Kraken build system

Kraken is a build system, but not in the traditional sense. It's focus is on the orchestration of high-level tasks,  
such as organization of your repository configuration, code generation, invoking other build systems, etc. It is not a  
replacement for tools like Poetry, Cargo or CMake.

**Requirements**

*   CPython 3.10+

## Getting started

Currently, Kraken's OSS components are not very well documented and do not provide a convenient way to get started.  
However, if you really want to try it, you can use the following steps:

Install `kraken-wrapper` (e.g. with [Uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)) to get access to the `krakenw` command-line tool.

Create a `.kraken.py` script in your project's root directory.

Run `krakenw lock` to install `kraken-build` for your project in `build/.kraken/venv` and generate a `kraken.lock` file.

Run `krakenw run lint` to run the linters.

> Note that you can also use the `kraken` CLI (instead of `krakenw`), however this will disregard the `buildscript()`  
> function, will not use the lock file and will use the version of Kraken that was installed globally.

## Development

This repository uses [Uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), but not currently a Uv-workspace because Kraken does not support that, yet. You may  
want to use a released version of `krakenw` instead of the live version in `kraken-wrapper/` to interact with this  
repository. You can use [Mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) to install all the tools you need.

```
$ mise install
$ eval "$(mise activate)"
$ krakenw run fmt lint test
```

## Release process

A release must be created by a maintainer that has write access to the `develop` branch.

```
$ ./scripts/bump.py X.Y.Z --release
```

The packages are published to PyPI from CI.
