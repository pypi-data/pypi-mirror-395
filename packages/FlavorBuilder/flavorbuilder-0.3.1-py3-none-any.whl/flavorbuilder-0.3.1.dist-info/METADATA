# FlavorBuilder
A unified Python framework for model building with finite flavor symmetries in particle physics. It integrates group-theory computations via [GAP](https://www.gap-system.org/) with model-building tools for constructing and analyzing flavor models. This package serves as a core component supporting our work in [arXiv:2506.08080 [hep-ph]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08080).

**PyDiscrete**: a Python reimplementation of the Mathematica package [Discrete](https://discrete.hepforge.org/), enabling group-theory computations via [GAP](https://www.gap-system.org/). It extracts group properties, character tables, computes Kronecker products and Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. See the tutorial notebook "TutorialPyDiscrete.ipynb" for more details.

**Model2Mass**: a symbolic and numerical framework for constructing Lagrangians, derive mass matrices, and compute phenomenologically relevant quantities for BSM flavor models with finite flavor symmetry.

The Tutorials folder in the [GitHub](https://github.com/victoria-kp/FlavorBuilder) contains Jupyter notebooks demonstrating how to use the two core packages. The FastEvaluation folder in the [GitHub](https://github.com/victoria-kp/FlavorBuilder) includes a notebook with all the necessary code to derive the analytical expressions for the mass matrices and compute the corresponding χ² values using the parameters stored in the .txt files. This notebook can also be used to validate the neutrino flavor models presented in [arXiv:2506.08080 [hep-ph]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08080) .

# Requirements:
1. Python ≥ 3.9
2. [GAP](https://www.gap-system.org/) ≥ 4.11.1
3. Dependencies: numpy, sympy, pandas, json, os, itertools, random, collections, numbers, subprocess, ast, re, pickle and the optionally IPython (for LaTeX table visualization)

# Installation 
Option 1: You can install FlavorBuilder from PyPI with pip by running
```bash

   pip install FlavorBuilder
```

Option 2: You can also download the package from [GitHub](https://github.com/victoria-kp/FlavorBuilder) and add it to your Python path:

```bash

   import sys, os
   src_path = "path/FlavorBuilder/src"
   sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath(src_path))

   from FlavorBuilder.PyDiscrete import Group
   from FlavorBuilder.Model2Mass import Model2Mass
```
