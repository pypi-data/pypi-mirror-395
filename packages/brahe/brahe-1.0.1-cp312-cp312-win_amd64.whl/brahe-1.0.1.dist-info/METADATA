# Brahe

Brahe is a modern satellite dynamics library for research and engineering applications. It is designed to be quick-to-deploy, composable, extensible, and easy-to-learn. The north-star of the development is enabling users to solve meaningful problems quickly and correctly.

Brahe is permissively licensed under an [MIT License](https://github.com/duncaneddy/brahe/blob/main/LICENSE) to enable people to use and build on the work without worrying about licensing restrictions. We want people to be able to stop reinventing the astrodynamics "wheel" because commercial licenses are expensive and open-source options are hard to use.

We try to prioritize making the software library easy to understand and extend. Many astrodynamics libraries are written in a way that makes them hard to read, understand, or modify. Brahe is written in a modern style with an emphasis on code clarity and modularity to make it easier to understand how algorithms are implemented and to make it easier to extend the library to support new use-cases. This approach has the added benefit of making it easier to verify and validate the correctness of the implementation.

If you do find this useful, please consider starring the repository on GitHub to help increase its visibility. If you're using Brahe for school, research, a commercial endeavour, or flying a mission. I'd love to know about it.

We hope you find Brahe useful for your work!

## Going Further

If you want to learn more about how to use the package the documentation is structured in the following way:

- **[Learn](https://duncaneddy.github.io/brahe/learn/)**: Provides short-form documentation of major concepts of the package.
- **[Examples](https://duncaneddy.github.io/brahe/examples/)**: Provides longer-form examples of how-to examples of accomplish common tasks.
- **[Python API Reference](https://duncaneddy.github.io/brahe/library_api/)**: Provides detailed reference documentation of the Python API.
- **[Rust API Reference](https://docs.rs/brahe)**: Provides detailed reference documentation of the Rust API.

## Quick Start

### Python

To install the latest release of brahe for Python, simply run:

```bash
pip install brahe
```

You can then import the package in your Python code with:

```python
import brahe as bh
```

And do something fun like calculate the orbital-period of a satellite in low Earth orbit:

``` python
import brahe as bh

# Define the semi-major axis of a low Earth orbit (in meters)
a = bh.constants.R_EARTH + 400e3  # 400 km altitude

# Calculate the orbital period
T = bh.orbital_period(a)

print(f"Orbital Period: {T / 60:.2f} minutes")
# Outputs:
# Orbital Period: 92.56 minutes
```

or find the when the ISS will next pass overhead:

``` python
import brahe as bh

bh.initialize_eop()

# Compute upcoming passes of the ISS over San Francisco
passes = bh.location_accesses(
    bh.PointLocation(-122.4194, 37.7749, 0.0),  # San Francisco
    bh.celestrak.get_tle_by_id_as_propagator(25544, 60.0, "active"),  # ISS
    bh.Epoch.now(),
    bh.Epoch.now() + 24 * 3600.0,  # Next 24 hours
    bh.ElevationConstraint(min_elevation_deg=10.0),
)
print(f"Number of passes in next 24 hours: {len(passes)}")
# Example Output: Number of passes in next 24 hours: 5
```

If you want to see more examples of how to use brahe, you can find even more with full source code in the [Examples section](https://duncaneddy.github.io/brahe/latest/examples/index.html) of the documentation.
