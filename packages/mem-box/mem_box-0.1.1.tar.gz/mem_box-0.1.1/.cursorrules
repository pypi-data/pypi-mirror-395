# MANDATORY: Read CONTRIBUTING.md Before ANY Code Changes

**All development guidelines are in `/workspace/CONTRIBUTING.md`**

Before coding:
1. Read CONTRIBUTING.md
2. Follow TDD (tests first, then code, then refactor)
3. Ask before implementing
4. Separate database/business logic
5. Run `make check-guidelines` after changes

**Violations = Rejection**
