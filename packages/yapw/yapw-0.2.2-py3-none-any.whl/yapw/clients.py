    Reconnects to RabbitMQ if the connection is closed unexpectedly or can't be established.

    Calling :meth:`~yapw.clients.Async.start` connects to RabbitMQ, add signal handlers, and starts the IO loop.

    The signal handlers cancel the consumer, if consuming and if the channel is open. Otherwise, they wait for threads
    to terminate and close the connection. This also occurs if the broker cancels the consumer or if the channel closes
    for any other reason.

    Once the IO loop starts, the client creates a channel, sets the prefetch count, and declares the
    exchange. Once the exchange is declared, the :meth:`~yapw.clients.Async.exchange_declareok_callback` calls
    :meth:`~yapw.clients.Async.exchange_ready`. You can define this method in a subclass, to do any work you need.

    If the connection becomes `blocked <https://www.rabbitmq.com/connection-blocked.html>`__ or unblocked, the
    client's ``blocked`` attribute is set to ``True`` or ``False``, respectively. Your code can use this attribute to,
