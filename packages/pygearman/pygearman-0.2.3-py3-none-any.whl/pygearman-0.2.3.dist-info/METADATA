pygearman
==============

This is a Gearman API written in Python -- client, worker and admin client interfaces.

For information about Gearman and a C-based Gearman server, see `<http://gearman.org/>`_.

This is a fork of the `wellcomecollection/python-gearman <https://github.com/wellcomecollection/python-gearman>`_ project, which is a fork of the original `Yelp/python-gearman <https://github.com/Yelp/python-gearman>`_ project.
You can use this library if you have an existing project that uses python-gearman or gearman3 and you want to upgrade to Python 3.9+.

This fork fixes the compatibility to Python 3.9+.

Installation
************

This library is published on PyPI as `pygearman <https://pypi.org/project/pygearman/>`_.
You can install it using pip:

.. code-block::

   pip install pygearman

The library is tested with Python 3.6 and 3.12.


Usage
*****

This is a drop-in replacement for the 2.x python-gearman and 0.2 gearman3 libraries.
There are docs at `<https://pythonhosted.org/gearman/>`_.


Development
***********

I created this fork so we'd have a Python 3-compatible version of Gearman to use in `Archivematica <https://github.com/artefactual/archivematica>`_.

I'll accept bugfixes for improving compatibility with Python 3, but I'm unlikely to accept new features or changes to the library's behaviour.
If you want to make big changes, I suggest creating your own fork.

New patches should come with tests and a release note.

See `<developers.rst>`_ for more notes on development, and in particular instructions for creating pull requests.
