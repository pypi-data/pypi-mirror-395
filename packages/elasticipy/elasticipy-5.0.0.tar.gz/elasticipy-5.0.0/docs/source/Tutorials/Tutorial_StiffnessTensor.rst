Computing and plotting engineering constants
============================================


This page illustrates how one can create stiffness (or compliance) tensors, manipulate them and plot some
elasticity-related values (e.g. Young modulus).

Direction-dependent Young moduli
--------------------------------

First, create a stiffness tensor with a given symmetry (let say, monoclinic):

.. doctest::

    >>> from Elasticipy.tensors.elasticity import StiffnessTensor
    >>> C = StiffnessTensor.monoclinic(phase_name='TiNi',
    ...                                C11=231, C12=127, C13=104,
    ...                                C22=240, C23=131, C33=175,
    ...                                C44=81, C55=11, C66=85,
    ...                                C15=-18, C25=1, C35=-3, C46=3)

Let's investigate the Young modulus:

    >>> E = C.Young_modulus

Here ``E`` is a ``SphericalFunction`` object. It means that its value depends on the considered direction. For instance,
let's see its value along the x, y and z directions:

    >>> Ex = E.eval([1,0,0])
    >>> Ey = E.eval([0,1,0])
    >>> Ez = E.eval([0,0,1])
    >>> print((Ex, Ey, Ez))
    (124.52232440357189, 120.92120854784433, 96.13750721721384)

.. note::

    As the components for the stiffness tensor were provided in GPa, the values for the Young modulus are given in GPa
    as well.

Actually, a more compact syntax, and a faster way to do that, is to use:

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> print(E.eval(np.eye(3)))
    [124.5223244  120.92120855  96.13750722]

To quickly see the min/max value of a ``SphericalFunction``, just print it:

    >>> print(E)
    Spherical function
    Min=26.28357770763925, Max=191.39659146987594

It is clear that this material is highly anisotropic. This can be evidenced by comparing the mean and the standard
deviation of the Young modulus:

    >>> E_mean = E.mean()
    >>> E_std = E.std()
    >>> print(E_std / E_mean)
    0.45580071168605646

Another way to evidence anisotropy is to use the universal anisotropy factor [1]_:

    >>> C.universal_anisotropy
    5.141009551641412

Shear moduli and Poisson ratios
-------------------------------
The shear modulus can be computed from the stiffness tensor as well:

    >>> G = C.shear_modulus
    >>> print(G)
    Hyperspherical function
    Min=8.748742560860755, Max=86.60555127546397

Here, the shear modulus is a ``HyperSphericalFunction`` object because its value depends on two orthogonal directions
(in other words, its arguments must lie on an unit hypersphere S3).

Let's compute its value with respect to X and Y directions:

    >>> print(G.eval([1,0,0], [0,1,0]))
    84.88888888888889

The previous consideration also apply for the Poisson ratio:

    >>> print(C.Poisson_ratio)
    Hyperspherical function
    Min=-0.5501886056193297, Max=1.4394343811866284

Plotting
--------

Spherical functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In order to fully evidence the directional dependence of the Young moduli, we can plot them as 3D surface:

.. plot::

    from Elasticipy.tensors.elasticity import StiffnessTensor
    C = StiffnessTensor.cubic(C11=186, C12=134, C44=77)
    E = C.Young_modulus
    E.plot3D()

It is advised to use interactive plot to be able to zoom/rotate the surface. For flat images (i.e. to put in
document/articles), we can plot the values as a Pole Figure (PF):

.. plot::

    from Elasticipy.tensors.elasticity import StiffnessTensor
    C = StiffnessTensor.cubic(C11=186, C12=134, C44=77)
    E = C.Young_modulus
    E.plot_as_pole_figure()


Alternatively, we can plot the Young moduli on X-Y, X-Z and Y-Z sections only:

.. plot::

    from Elasticipy.tensors.elasticity import StiffnessTensor
    C = StiffnessTensor.cubic(C11=186, C12=134, C44=77)
    E = C.Young_modulus
    E.plot_xyz_sections()

Hyperspherical functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Hyperspherical functions cannot plotted as 3D surfaces, as their values depend on two orthogonal directions.
But at least, for a each direction **u**, we can consider the mean value for all the orthogonal directions **v** when
plotting:

.. plot::

    from Elasticipy.tensors.elasticity import StiffnessTensor
    C = StiffnessTensor.cubic(C11=186, C12=134, C44=77)
    G = C.shear_modulus
    G.plot3D()

Instead of the mean value, we can consider other statistics, e.g.:

.. plot::

    from Elasticipy.tensors.elasticity import StiffnessTensor
    C = StiffnessTensor.cubic(C11=186, C12=134, C44=77)
    G = C.shear_modulus
    G.plot3D(which='min')

This also works for ``max`` and ``std``. These parameters also apply for pole figures (see above).

When plotting the X-Y, X-Z and Y-Z sections, the min, max and mean values are plotted at once:

.. plot::

    from Elasticipy.tensors.elasticity import StiffnessTensor
    C = StiffnessTensor.cubic(C11=186, C12=134, C44=77)
    G = C.shear_modulus
    G.plot_xyz_sections()

.. note::
