## 📖 Overview

The Oxylabs MCP server provides a bridge between AI models and the web. It enables them to scrape any URL, render JavaScript-heavy pages, extract and format content for AI use, bypass anti-scraping measures, and access geo-restricted web data from 195+ countries.


## 🛠️ MCP Tools

Oxylabs MCP provides two sets of tools that can be used together or independently:

### Oxylabs Web Scraper API Tools
1. **universal_scraper**: Uses Oxylabs Web Scraper API for general website scraping;
2. **google_search_scraper**: Uses Oxylabs Web Scraper API to extract results from Google Search;
3. **amazon_search_scraper**: Uses Oxylabs Web Scraper API to scrape Amazon search result pages;
4. **amazon_product_scraper**: Uses Oxylabs Web Scraper API to extract data from individual Amazon product pages.

### Oxylabs AI Studio Tools

5. **ai_scraper**: Scrape content from any URL in JSON or Markdown format with AI-powered data extraction;
6. **ai_crawler**: Based on a prompt, crawls a website and collects data in Markdown or JSON format across multiple pages;
7. **ai_browser_agent**: Based on prompt, controls a browser and returns data in Markdown, JSON, HTML, or screenshot formats;
8. **ai_search**: Search the web for URLs and their contents with AI-powered content extraction.


## ✅ Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have **at least one** of the following:

- **Oxylabs Web Scraper API Account**: Obtain your username and password from [Oxylabs](https://dashboard.oxylabs.io/) (1-week free trial available);
- **Oxylabs AI Studio API Key**: Obtain your API key from [Oxylabs AI Studio](https://aistudio.oxylabs.io/settings/api-key). (1000 credits free).

## 📦 Configuration

### Environment variables

Oxylabs MCP server supports the following environment variables:
| Name                       | Description                                   | Default |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------|
| `OXYLABS_USERNAME`         | Your Oxylabs Web Scraper API username         |         |
| `OXYLABS_PASSWORD`         | Your Oxylabs Web Scraper API password         |         |
| `OXYLABS_AI_STUDIO_API_KEY`| Your Oxylabs AI Studio API key                |         |
| `LOG_LEVEL`                | Log level for the logs returned to the client | `INFO`  |

Based on provided credentials, the server will automatically expose the corresponding tools:
- If only `OXYLABS_USERNAME` and `OXYLABS_PASSWORD` are provided, the server will expose the Web Scraper API tools;
- If only `OXYLABS_AI_STUDIO_API_KEY` is provided, the server will expose the AI Studio tools;
- If both `OXYLABS_USERNAME` and `OXYLABS_PASSWORD` and `OXYLABS_AI_STUDIO_API_KEY` are provided, the server will expose all tools.

❗❗❗ **Important note: if you don't have Web Scraper API or Oxylabs AI studio credentials, delete the corresponding environment variables placeholders.
Leaving placeholder values will result in exposed tools that do not work.**
