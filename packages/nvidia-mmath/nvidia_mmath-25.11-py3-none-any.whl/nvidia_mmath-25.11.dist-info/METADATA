# MMATH

This is the official repository for the paper **"MMATH: A Multilingual Benchmark for Mathematical Reasoning"**.

## 📖 Introduction

**MMATH** is a new benchmark specifically designed for multilingual complex reasoning. It comprises 374 carefully selected math problems from high-quality sources, including AIME, CNMO, and MATH-500, and covers ten typologically and geographically diverse languages. Each problem is translated and validated through a rigorous pipeline that combines frontier LLMs with human verification, ensuring semantic consistency.

## NVIDIA NeMo Evaluator

MMATH provides you with evaluation clients that are specifically built to evaluate model endpoints using our Standard API.

### Launching an evaluation for an LLM

#### Install the package

```bash
pip install nvidia-mmath
```

#### (Optional) Set a token to your API endpoint if it's protected

```bash
export MY_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
export HF_TOKEN="your_huggingface_token_here"
```

#### List the available evaluations

```bash
nemo-evaluator ls
```

Available tasks:
* mmath_en (in mmath)
* mmath_zh (in mmath)
* mmath_ar (in mmath)
* mmath_es (in mmath)
* mmath_fr (in mmath)
* mmath_ja (in mmath)
* mmath_ko (in mmath)
* mmath_pt (in mmath)
* mmath_th (in mmath)
* mmath_vi (in mmath)

#### Run the evaluation of your choice

```bash
nemo-evaluator run_eval \
    --eval_type mmath_en \
    --model_id meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct \
    --model_url https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1/chat/completions \
    --model_type chat \
    --api_key_name MY_API_KEY \
    --output_dir /workspace/results
```

#### Gather the results

```bash
cat /workspace/results/results.yml
```

### Command-Line Tool

Each package comes pre-installed with a set of command-line tools, designed to simplify the execution of evaluation tasks. Below are the available commands and their usage for the mmath evaluations:

#### Commands

##### 1. List Evaluation Types

```bash
nemo-evaluator ls
```

Displays the evaluation types available within the harness.

##### 2. Run an evaluation

The `nemo-evaluator run_eval` command executes the evaluation process. Below are the flags and their descriptions:

**Required flags:**

- `--eval_type <string>`: The type of evaluation to perform (e.g., mmath_en, mmath_zh, etc.)
- `--model_id <string>`: The name or identifier of the model to evaluate.
- `--model_url <url>`: The API endpoint where the model is accessible.
- `--model_type <string>`: The type of the model to evaluate, currently either "chat", "completions", or "vlm".
- `--output_dir <directory>`: The directory to use as the working directory for the evaluation. The results, including the results.yml output file, will be saved here.

**Optional flags:**

- `--api_key_name <string>`: The name of the environment variable that stores the Bearer token for the API, if authentication is required.
- `--run_config <path>`: Specifies the path to a YAML file containing the evaluation definition.
- `--overrides <string>`: Override configuration parameters (e.g., 'config.params.limit_samples=10').

#### Example

```bash
nemo-evaluator run_eval \
    --eval_type mmath_en \
    --model_id meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct \
    --model_type chat \
    --model_url https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1/chat/completions \
    --output_dir ./evaluation_results
```

If the model API requires authentication, set the API key in an environment variable and reference it using the `--api_key_name` flag:

```bash
export MY_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"

nemo-evaluator run_eval \
    --eval_type mmath_en \
    --model_id meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct \
    --model_type chat \
    --model_url https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1/chat/completions \
    --api_key_name MY_API_KEY \
    --output_dir ./evaluation_results
```

### Configuring evaluations via YAML

Evaluations in MMATH are configured using YAML files that define the parameters and settings required for the evaluation process. These configuration files follow a standard API which ensures consistency across evaluations.

**Example of a YAML config:**

```yaml
config:
  type: mmath_en
  params:
    parallelism: 50
    limit_samples: 20
target:
  api_endpoint:
    model_id: meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct
    type: chat
    url: https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1/chat/completions
    api_key: NVIDIA_API_KEY
```

The priority of overrides is as follows:

1. command line arguments
2. user config (as seen above)
3. task defaults (defined per task type)
4. framework defaults

The `--dry_run` option allows you to print the final run configuration and command without executing the evaluation.

**Example:**

```bash
nemo-evaluator run_eval \
    --eval_type mmath_en \
    --model_id meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct \
    --model_type chat \
    --model_url https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1/chat/completions \
    --output_dir ./evaluation_results \
    --dry_run
```

## 🛠️ Code and Data Usage

MMATH has the following resources. The `mmath` folder contains the benchmark data. The `train` folder contains the training data at Section 3. `mmath_eval.py` is the main program to evaluate the accuracy results, while `calculate_lcr.py` calculates the value of LCR as defined in our paper.

```

│  mmath_eval.py
│  utils.py

The example in mmath/xx.json has the following format:

```json
{
        "question": "Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.", # The question 
        "answer": "204",			# The answer
        "data_source": "AIME2024",  # The data source, which might be AIME2024/AIME2025/CNMO/MATH500
        "data_source_id": 0,        # The index in original data
        "lang": "en",				# Language type
        "gid": 0					# The global id in our benchmark MMATH
},
```

The example in train/yy.json has the following format:

```json
{
        "index":0,
        "answer":"364",
        "conversations":[
            {
                "from":"user",
                "value":"For a positive integer \\( n \\), consider the function\n\n\\[ \nf(n)=\\frac{4n+\\sqrt{4n^2-1}}{\\sqrt{2n+1}+\\sqrt{2n-1}} \n\\]\n\nCalculate the value of\n\n\\[ \nf(1)+f(2)+f(3)+\\cdots+f(40) \n\\]"
            },
            {
                "from":"assistant",
                "value":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the sum of f(1) + f(2) + ...Thus, the sum is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} (729 - 1) = \\frac{728}{2} = 364.\n\\]\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{364}\n\\]"
            }
        ]
},
```

## 🧪 Experiment Setup

### Environment Setups

To accelerate the process of environment setup, we use `uv` to manage the packages. And our training code is based on [LLaMA-Factory](https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory), you can install it based on your requirements (e.g, with -e option).

```bash
conda create -n mmath python=3.10
conda activate mmath
pip install uv
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Evaluation Commands

#### Accuracy Results

To calculate accuracy results on our benchmark, you can run with:

```bash
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1
python mmath_eval.py --model_name_or_path DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B --tensor_parallel_size 2
```

This will generate a `results` directory with a subdirectory with the model name (e.g, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B). Inside the directory are the results belonging to different languages, such as `en.json`.

#### LCR Results

As for calculating LCR, please download the `lid.176.bin` with:

```bash
wget https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/fasttext/supervised-models/lid.176.bin
```

After that, please set the `model_list_full` variable in `calculate_lcr.py`. Then, you can run the command using `python calculate_lcr.py`.

```python
model_list_full = [
    "DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B",
    # ...
]
```

This will rewrite some keys in `results/model_name/xx.json` and output a LaTeX table about the whole results.
